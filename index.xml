I&#8217;m Hessie Jones, and welcome to Tech on censored. I&#8217;m so happy today to introduce someone I&#8217;ve known for many years. He&#8217;s a serial entrepreneur and he was also my advisor when I actually launched my own business. So I&#8217;ll give you a little bit of background, Ryan Pannell. Is a different kind of entrepreneur. He actually has successfully navigated 3 major pivots over his diverse career. He actually began in film, and he started out as a writer, end up being a producer, eventually director and before starting his own production company. And when he was just 26 years young, he actually directed his first feature film called Dragon City. So Next up. At a time when the world was actually transitioning towards Y2K, he completely pivoted and he moved to the startup technology space, and he pioneered a cryptographic web-based technology, and he brought it to big play. Others like Visa, Microsoft as well as the Bank of Scotland. OK, so next thing, he also developed this traumatic brain injury software circa 2001 that seemed to save many lives in parts of the US and this is something completely new that I had no idea about, Ryan. So Fast forward 2013, Ryan pivoted again and this time he&#8217;s. Did focus towards the financial sector and he is now the CEO and Global chair of Kaiju Worldwide, which is a hedge fund management company and it spans across 3 continents. So from his perspective this is not a normal hedge fund company and I think. For many people within the text state within the finance phase, we&#8217;re starting to see this emerging emergence of AI within our technology. But for for Kaiju, it&#8217;s about quantitative analysis, behavioral finance, as well as quantum mechanics and AI. Finally, we&#8217;re going to talk about his philanthropy, and Ryan donates a lot of his time towards ocean conservation, but he also provide provides the story, believes in providing tech access to underprivileged youth, among many, many of the things that he already does. So we&#8217;re going to. Learn a lot about Ryan Pannell today and his life lessons as an entrepreneur and where he&#8217;s headed in the future. So welcome, Ryan. So nice to see you again.</p>						</div>

Well, I wanted you on because Altitude Accelerator supports a lot of startup founders and for them this ends up being a journey that spans a lot of failures, challenge challenges, really amazing moments, but I want them to hear from your perspective. Because you&#8217;ve gone through this multiple times. So let&#8217;s start with the first question. So your journey. Is one that leaps into many of these disparate industries. You had no previous knowledge, really or nor experience in some of these, but you decided to delve into this next thing, which I guess most people would think is incredibly risky, is that is that accurate?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Ryan Pannell</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Ohh I don&#8217;t know, I mean it it always seems risky in hindsight. You know, at the time it seems like a good idea and yeah, let&#8217;s just be bold and go do that. And then you look back years later and you think, Oh my God, I can&#8217;t believe that, you know, I did that or we did that. And you know, my my wife and I talked about that a lot. You know, when we we moved to Barbados nine years ago before moving to Switzerland three years ago. And when we moved to Barbados, we thought we were completely prepared, ready to go. New adventure, young kids. This will be awesome. And we like, completely did. Not have the asset. Base that we required to make that move safely, serendipitously. You know, everything changed right after I moved my my career in asset management just skyrocketed. So that saved us. But at the time, I mean, if I had to do it again, knowing then what I know now, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have done it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Hessie jones</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">But so it seems like you kind of roll with the punches, right. And in your life, would you say, would you say that that is a hallmark of what entrepreneurship is all about, really?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Ryan Pannell</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">I&#8217;d say more than rolling with the punches. I&#8217;ve never been afraid. I never say never. I almost never have been afraid to make a change. Change when something that I was involved with before stopped working. You know, a lot of people. I mean we we&#8217;ve got this problem in in society, period, not just in entrepreneurial circles where if you don&#8217;t quote UN quote finish what you start you&#8217;re seen as a failure or a quitter or someone who. Doesn&#8217;t stick it out. Like, but how does it make any sense to continue doing something that&#8217;s not working that&#8217;s not profitable? That&#8217;s not making you happy? Like, if you suddenly realize or or gradually come to the realization that whatever it is you&#8217;re doing is just not going to work. Then every extra minute you spend doing that is a minute wasted and a minute you&#8217;re not doing something else, so that more than rolling with the punches because it&#8217;s not really reactive, it&#8217;s just based on a clinical analysis of where I am, what opportunities exist on the current path versus opportunities that exist. On a new path. Limited opportunities here. Better opportunities over there. OK, what do I have to do to make this change? Let&#8217;s make. The change. Let&#8217;s move on. Let&#8217;s evolve.

From that perspective.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Ryan Pannell</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">I mean, sometimes it&#8217;s very reactionary, you know, we were building early just web-based applications. This is before SAS was thing and I was running a software development company and had realized in the. Early part, you know, right after 2000, early part of 2000 into 2000 and. Run that building local software will always carry the inherent problem of conflicts on a local machine, like you can&#8217;t possibly. Predict. The build of every single machine that&#8217;s out there so you know you build the software, you build it to be universally compliant and inevitably you get some client that calls you and says, well, this doesn&#8217;t work or I got this. Error. But you know, even back then we realized that browser based technologies. As long as it. Was compliant with the browser. It was likely going to work. On the system. And so we. Were involved in these early web technologies and after the dot com collapse one of the advantageous things happened. Which happened for in the entrepreneurial space. Base was the collapse of all of these data centers. So, so eBay basically got flooded with cheap enterprise grade technology and so we built, you know, an enormous part of our infrastructure out of failed other dot com companies. You&#8217;re buying these servers that were twenty $30,000 for 1400 bucks. And I had bought some enormous universe of power supply, you know, like a floor unit. And it never showed up. And I knew this guy had received the emails I sent, and he was just messing with me. I called my senior network analyst in and I said this guy&#8217;s lying. I want to prove that he got my E-mail like how do we do that? And he just. Kind of looked at. Me and said, well, you can&#8217;t, you know, like everybody else, I misunderstood how e-mail worked, I thought. You know, goes from my computer to your computer.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Not that it goes through, you know, a million servers, you know, including two ISP&#8217;s or multiple ISP&#8217;s that it could fall out of its TLS conduit that you could have a bad collision and the e-mail would never arrive intact. No idea. And I couldn&#8217;t believe that we couldn&#8217;t. Track these communications and so that bad transaction on eBay led me to build what was at the time the most secure electronic file delivery system on the planet. It was like point to point 4096 bit encrypted like we got, we got e-mail, we got even got. Emails we got. Registered mail from government. Agencies warning us not to export the cryptography at that strength, but you know like that was it wasn&#8217;t like I had a love of cryptography and I always wanted to do it. It was a reaction to something that happened. We had the infrastructure to build it. And so that&#8217;s the direction that we went in. And so many of them were were like that, you know, shifting. Shifting from film and television into web-based technologies involved a brief stint. You know in web development, and this is at a time when the the the opening or landing page of a website like the animated landing page is like a big deal with. So. So having this cinematic background. The company that I started built these cinematic opening pages that really drew people in and we won two flash forward. Awards, which was. An award given by Macromedia before Flash got absorbed by by Adobe and that got us a lot of interest, so moving from. Film and television into technology. We just saw that if the future of filmmaking was there. We were deficient.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">In the technology side, so we wanted to get.

Of your articles that you wrote, it was called 5 under appreciated strategies. For improving performance, so can you elaborate a little bit on that, because I think focus is one of the things but but really it it&#8217;s really about mindset it&#8217;s it&#8217;s about wellness physically as well as mentally.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Ryan Pannell</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Yeah, I mean. I always found it interesting that when people are looking for a competitive advantage or they&#8217;re looking to improve. Their performance, you know, like one of the first things they do is they pop open like the App Store and they look at, you know, productivity apps or they go to like, you know, life hacks from the perspective. Of can can I can I jog on my under desk treadmill while I listen to podcasts and return emails? Like that&#8217;s that&#8217;s not where your performance is actually going to come from. It&#8217;s there&#8217;s some really low hanging fruit that people consistently ignore. That works for everybody. It&#8217;s free and absolutely makes a difference. And so yeah, in. That article I talk about like. I think number one was. Sleep. I you know people we know. Oh, you should get more sleep. Ohh yeah. You know, I I don&#8217;t get enough sleep. I could use more sleep. I hate catching up my sleep on the way. Everybody knows. It&#8217;s like eating your vegetables. You know, you should do it. But most people don&#8217;t really understand the critical role that sleep plays. In life. Period. Right. I mean. All of your physiological repetitive functions happen when you&#8217;re asleep. That&#8217;s cell repair. That&#8217;s hormone balance. That&#8217;s conversion of short term memory and long term. Memory like if you don&#8217;t get enough sleep, it&#8217;s not like your body will do that at some other time or at a lower level of efficiency. It won&#8217;t do it. So you have like 3 whiskeys and go to bed. Your body will not repair cellular damage, it&#8217;s going to spend the whole night trying to process the toxin that you just ingested. Instead of doing what you needed to do, no short term memory, moving to long term memory, no hormone balance. So you&#8217;re you&#8217;re waking up and you&#8217;re trying to get the most out of your day with a broken down machine. You know, like first thing you can do, it&#8217;s free. Go to sleep earlier. Like, what are you doing after 9:00? And that probably nothing useful watching TV doing scrolling social media. Right. You&#8217;re doing this stuff. That&#8217;s not going to have any meaningful impact on your life to be unconscious. You feel so much better the next day, and because your body was able to do all of the things that it&#8217;s designed to do, everybody&#8217;s body. There is advantage number one, you know caffeine modulation #2, right? The fact that we don&#8217;t get enough sleep habitually leads to caffeine abuse. Not I&#8217;m not someone that that avoids caffeine. There&#8217;s a lot of benefits to caffeine. There&#8217;s benefits to drinking coffee. People don&#8217;t understand what it does.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Or how it&#8217;s doing it. You know that your body is producing. This, this adenosine sleep hormone in 24 hour cycles and caffeine stops that hormone from being absorbed and so it&#8217;s stopping it&#8217;s stopping. It&#8217;s stopping but it doesn&#8217;t eliminate it so it&#8217;s bonding to it and it&#8217;s building up building up, building up and eventually when the caffeine degrades, all of that adenosine is released into your system. And that&#8217;s why you feel like exhausted halfway. Through the day. Because now you&#8217;re getting all of it, and that&#8217;s why your afternoon coffee is never as effective as the morning one like you have this afternoon. Coffee. You&#8217;re like, oh, my God, I need this coffee. It will stop new adenosine from being absorbed. But that big tidal wave has already hit you, so now it&#8217;s not doing as much, so you drink more coffee in the afternoon. Now you&#8217;re not going to fall asleep, right? Like I have, like, one to two coffees in the morning. I I have a small coffee, you know, noon, 1:00 and I have nothing for the rest of. The day I don&#8217;t get that lull anymore, which then makes me more efficient, like two, you know? There you go. Sleep and and focus on your caffeine intake. If you use caffeine and performance will go up like 300% without you downloading an app. Or going to some retreat or listening to Wim Hoff or whatever the hell it is. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Hessie Jones</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Do you do any meditation?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Ryan Pannell</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">I do actually that&#8217;s how I start every day and I like not in some sort of guru instructed way I wake up in the morning, I go to actually it&#8217;s like our TV room but it&#8217;s really quiet and it&#8217;s another part of the house.

Biggest risk that I&#8217;ve ever seen in all startups, my own, and others that I&#8217;ve seen not succeed is and an overly high level of optimism combined. With under capitalization like you know I want to start this business. I have some money. It is for sure not enough money, probably, but you think it is. So you know you start the business. And as you you start to blow through this money, you start to make bad decisions. So the bad decisions are commonly you avoid legal services, right? You, you you don&#8217;t send contracts to lawyers, you download them off the Internet. You read them. They seem to be pretty good. You know, you execute them opening yourself with the liability and risk because lawyer fees are really high, even cheap lawyers cost money that you don&#8217;t actually see translating to to revenue, so you won&#8217;t do that. Partners don&#8217;t make partnership agreements in the beginning. Because some part of you knows that you&#8217;re going. To have a. Fight right away and you want to be really positive and you&#8217;re like, we&#8217;re going to. Change the world with this. And you come back around to having that agreement in the future when there&#8217;s actual money on the table. And that&#8217;s a way worse fight to have. So people do things like that. You know, I&#8217;ve got more than enough. I can do this. They&#8217;re undercapitalized, bad decisions, and it just goes down downhill from there, really. And I see that that&#8217;s that&#8217;s 95% of failed startups. I can track back to. Under capitalization.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Hessie Jones</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">And I think I think for for a lot of people like you said, there&#8217;s a lot of optimism in the beginning. But then when the decision to actually do things that require money, they don&#8217;t actually happen when they should happen. You know, everybody tries to get it done, like, right at the beginning, like the agreement thing. There, there are lessons in that in that if there were agreement, maybe we could have mitigated this specific risk in the future, right? But that again comes with a cost.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Ryan Pannell</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Yeah. And it&#8217;s, but it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not huge. It&#8217;s just something, right, like, you know, it depends on what country you&#8217;re in. But you know, if memory serves Canada, it&#8217;s been a while, but, you know, like $1500 or something, and you&#8217;ve incorporated a company. OK. So I&#8217;ve incorporated a company now the extra. Legal work making sure that that company is set up to run effectively would bring the total startup cost. For admin and legals to maybe 10 grand like, it&#8217;s not a ton of money and now it&#8217;s set up optimally from the beginning. Shareholder agreements are in place. Everything&#8217;s super clear. You start on the right page and if you&#8217;re engaging contractors like you have. Good quality terms and conditions that are. Going to keep. You safe insulated from liability, et cetera like that, plus a bank account. And you&#8217;re ready to go. Ohh and it&#8217;s just you know the it&#8217;s the extra $8500 in legal fees that people think ohh, but that will get me a BCD instead everybody wants to feel like they&#8217;re in business, so they want their website and then with their social channels and they want a cool zoom background or. Whatever it is that they&#8217;re gonna put in place that&#8217;s going to make it seem like they&#8217;re they&#8217;re not like a one man or one gal band.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">And you&#8217;re missing like the part that you are, you can&#8217;t redo that after the fact, like you got one chance to do it. And that&#8217;s the chance to do it, I would say. You know, for me that&#8217;s number one. Number two would be not doing the appropriate amount of research in terms of where your revenue is going to come from. Like you have this great idea, you think it&#8217;s going to change the world based on. Your gut. You know, I&#8217;m going to do this. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be clients. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll get revenue. Like what? Market analysis have you done? Come to that conclusion if you haven&#8217;t done it, it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re afraid of learning that your dream idea isn&#8217;t a very good idea and you sort of just want to go. Same thing is you haven&#8217;t put a partnership agreement in place, not because you&#8217;re an idiot and you don&#8217;t know that you need it. It&#8217;s because you kind of feel like there might be a fight. And that would just throw cold water on everything. And you&#8217;re so excited and you want to move. Forward with positivity. This is business, right? Like you&#8217;re not gonna be friends forever. You&#8217;re building something together. So take the time to make sure you&#8217;re on the same page.

I couldn&#8217;t have done it at any other point in my life, and not just because AI wasn&#8217;t AI back then. I&#8217;ve been working specifically with AI and portfolio management since 2019. Like back then, people thought I was insane. We were insane for managing portfolios just using AI. But. It&#8217;s worked out really well and it&#8217;s been a very validating like last 18 months to be sure, but. It&#8217;s been a very complicated venture and I lacked. I lacked the knowledge. I lacked the wisdom, I lacked the emotional sophistication I lacked, the managerial experience, you know, I I had to go through the other careers, the other companies, the other businesses. To get to a point where. You know, I could run a company that you know has people in 17 countries and 13 time. Zones like it. Just wasn&#8217;t equipped to do that, wasn&#8217;t equipped to manage that many diverse personalities, requirements, cultures, et cetera, so. You know it&#8217;s it&#8217;s it&#8217;s been a a good journey. It&#8217;s satisfying for me to be able to see. Not not so much the success, but that recognize.

Very briefly, in retail trading, a couple of colleagues that I&#8217;d spent some time with. Who were also theoretical physicists had gone off to work at a big sell side bank in England and contacted me. From a quantitative perspective like hey, you know more and more banks, this is like 22,000 and twelve 2013, something like that. You know, banks are sort of hiring us more and more. And I was the pattern recognition specialist because I&#8217;ve spent so much time in applied cryptography and. That&#8217;s really all it is. You know, can you look at some data for us? Can you tell us if you? See anything there? I looked, I knew how to trade before, just recreationally, and I I I did see exploitable patterns and I I shared those with them the first couple of times and then realized that maybe I should stop sharing them. And so I I I started a small account. I built a number of trading systems. I started trading. That was very. Successful and through a mutual friend, I came to the attention of someone who was at the time Europe&#8217;s largest fund manager. And they very kindly and and different people in their in their. Management company mentored me. I became a portfolio manager. They&#8217;re institutional trader and then portfolio manager. And then in a very short amount of time. The same person said you need your own fund. You need to you need this is you need to be managing your own fund. So help me set up my first hedge fund and my first fund management company. And yeah, I had. I had some seconded staff from his company and it was like me and. Four other three other three other guys, you know, all working in technology, right? Like I, I I needed professional technologists to help build the proprietary systems that I wanted to build, like an architect them, but I couldn&#8217;t build them as. And you know from from there, we grew from those forty people to, you know, it&#8217;s almost 50 and from, you know, a couple of countries to 17 and from managing 1 little hedge fund to several funds to building IP to launching products on the New York Stock Exchange. We&#8217;re all using artificial intelligence.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">We knew that we wanted to go that direction. It just wasn&#8217;t accessible at our size and capital base until about 20-19 and then we. Had enough expertise on staff, we had enough capital and we, the technology itself, had become more accessible and we could really make a go of predictive AI, obviously not, not generative AI, which is the world&#8217;s worst fund management ChatGPT.

What&#8217;s not?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Hessie Jones</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And he started this hedge fund when he was, you know, 45 or 46. And, you know, for 30 years they&#8217;ve they&#8217;ve delivered like 67% returns net of all fees every year. But their employee owned like and have been for decades. They&#8217;re closed, so they they basically perfected systematic and quantitative trading. Went into early machine learning artificial intelligence application. Means used to have outside capital a long time ago and then kicked everybody out once they had enough of their own money and just run on that so that their medallion fund is, you know, 10 to $12 billion. That&#8217;s all employee owned. Nobody&#8217;s ever. Gets any information out of that shop because again, employee owned right? It it. It has the distinction of having the highest number of millionaire receptionists in the world, right? If you&#8217;re, if you&#8217;re making 67% after all fees every year, are you talking to anyone? No, of course not. So, you know, 30 years, we know, like, three things about them. You know their win win rate is slightly better than 50. Percent, which means that their asymmetrical return on risk is enormous. We know that they only trade in a three to eight day window, which substantiates all of our findings that predictive AI and in capital markets trading is only effective in the very immediate terms, not crystal ball. It&#8217;s not going to tell you where something going to be in six months. That&#8217;s that&#8217;s ridiculous. Uhm. And and that they only have there like 297 scientists and five traders, right. And and that mirrors sort of us, we&#8217;re smaller, but yeah, we have a we. Have. 8% of our workforce, 7% of our workforce are traders. Everybody else is a scientist. And you still need the traders. You know, the scientists themselves. The machines themselves don&#8217;t come up with very novel, innovative, workable solutions. You know, the traders still. Have to execute. Trades and some some asset classes et cetera and so. For what we. Do with predictive AI. Yeah, I see. A huge future. There but there. Or. There aren&#8217;t a lot of companies that are doing it. Citadel, absolutely, but they don&#8217;t talk about it like the companies that aren&#8217;t doing it are not talking about. They&#8217;re not sharing the technology. All the attention is on generative AI as an asset manager and analyst or whatever, and it&#8217;s terrible, you know, for all of the reasons I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve you&#8217;ve covered many, many times has. Like it&#8217;s there&#8217;s no standardized data, there&#8217;s no verifiable source of truth versus what we do is ingest like price, time and quantity data and look for repeating patterns very different.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Hessie Jones</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">So are you.

I think you&#8217;re done now, right. I mean, these systems, the types that we&#8217;re building and using, they&#8217;re ingesting the entire stock market at the trade level like what we call it, the print level, every single trade is being ingested. Analyzed in real time simultaneous. Obviously it&#8217;s billions of transactions before any one of our systems makes a trade management decisions. It&#8217;s billions of discrete examinations simultaneously before it makes the decision. We can&#8217;t do that we&#8217;re it&#8217;s not capable of that level of analysis. So it&#8217;s going to replace those, those traders, but it can&#8217;t do. Everything. It&#8217;s there&#8217;s global macro. Forget it. It&#8217;s there&#8217;s no system in the world that&#8217;s going to say. Well, I think that Putin&#8217;s going to invade Ukraine and I think this will be the socioeconomic fallout from that. And I think this will be the flow through of that fallout into capital markets. Like, no chance that requires, you know, a person with deep experience. And even then, they&#8217;re they&#8217;re they&#8217;re gonna be right. Like 30% of the time. So it&#8217;s not gonna do that. I don&#8217;t think anybody wants to take investment management advice from a machine which it&#8217;s not built that way. We&#8217;re a human. Human species. So I think we like that the investment manager has access to tools that will optimize decision making that can increase performance, decrease risk, can maybe act as an early warning signal in turbulent times. But we still don&#8217;t want, you know, to input all of our data and have a machine. Say, here&#8217;s your portfolio or this is what? You should do there&#8217;s. A small or that probably does. But that&#8217;s, you know, I like you, Hesse. I think that I think there&#8217;s no question AI is the technology of the future, but. The propensity of of purveyors to say that it can do everything and will replace everything is just absurd, and it it belies a lack of understanding and the of the technology itself.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Hessie Jones</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Yeah, I I mean I I was speaking to somebody yesterday about this existential threat that everybody had talks about.

And everything from shark finning, which takes out an apex predator which then sends the food chain into decay.

Hey, I&#8217;ll throw this plastic right into the ocean, but we sort of turn a blind eye to it because we don&#8217;t know what happens. General, I&#8217;m talking about general populace. What happens when it gets there so, you know, microplastics are not something that. A wonder kids, big ocean cleanup ship is going to fix like I completely applaud everyone of those initiatives.

You know you got an, you know, a Kindle Fire tablet, previous generation iPad, any, any number of tablets that you can use. That you can distribute to school kids. Most schools have free Wi-Fi connectivity even in Second World countries, and that connects them to education. It connects them to information. Limitless amounts of information.

I&#8217;d I&#8217;d like at the end of the day, like I&#8217;d like to have been useful. You know, I I get an enormous amount of satisfaction as a parent. Because I&#8217;m I spend a lot of time with my kids. I&#8217;m engaged. You know, I I care about what they&#8217;re doing. I care about trying to facilitate their interests. You know, whatever they may be, you know, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s really rewarding to see them grow. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed building Kaiju for the same reasons, you know. See it become meaningful for. Other people you know who maybe weren&#8217;t having the opportunities from wherever I stole them from that they now have it tied to you. You know, we&#8217;ve got a number of PHD&#8217;s that were. Ignored and treated as human calculators that we&#8217;ve brought on board, who have like invented incredible technology. That&#8217;s and that&#8217;s I didn&#8217;t do that. They did it, but I facilitated it and I I hope that when I&#8217;m gone. You know, people will say that they found, you know me in some way, useful, even the circuitous route that I took through life, the never ending mistakes and screw ups that I made. If I can act as a cautionary tale. To people that would make me happy, you know? Skip, skip these mistakes. That that&#8217;s all I really want to be at the end.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Hessie Jones</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Well, I guess from my perspective you do matter.
