I&amp;#8217;m Hessie Jones, and welcome to Tech on censored. I&amp;#8217;m so happy today to introduce someone I&amp;#8217;ve known for many years. He&amp;#8217;s a serial entrepreneur and he was also my advisor when I actually launched my own business. So I&amp;#8217;ll give you a little bit of background, Ryan Pannell. Is a different kind of entrepreneur. He actually has successfully navigated 3 major pivots over his diverse career. He actually began in film, and he started out as a writer, end up being a producer, eventually director and before starting his own production company. And when he was just 26 years young, he actually directed his first feature film called Dragon City. So Next up. At a time when the world was actually transitioning towards Y2K, he completely pivoted and he moved to the startup technology space, and he pioneered a cryptographic web-based technology, and he brought it to big play. Others like Visa, Microsoft as well as the Bank of Scotland. OK, so next thing, he also developed this traumatic brain injury software circa 2001 that seemed to save many lives in parts of the US and this is something completely new that I had no idea about, Ryan. So Fast forward 2013, Ryan pivoted again and this time he&amp;#8217;s. Did focus towards the financial sector and he is now the CEO and Global chair of Kaiju Worldwide, which is a hedge fund management company and it spans across 3 continents. So from his perspective this is not a normal hedge fund company and I think. For many people within the text state within the finance phase, we&amp;#8217;re starting to see this emerging emergence of AI within our technology. But for for Kaiju, it&amp;#8217;s about quantitative analysis, behavioral finance, as well as quantum mechanics and AI. Finally, we&amp;#8217;re going to talk about his philanthropy, and Ryan donates a lot of his time towards ocean conservation, but he also provide provides the story, believes in providing tech access to underprivileged youth, among many, many of the things that he already does. So we&amp;#8217;re going to. Learn a lot about Ryan Pannell today and his life lessons as an entrepreneur and where he&amp;#8217;s headed in the future. So welcome, Ryan. So nice to see you again.&lt;/p&gt;						&lt;/div&gt;

Well, I wanted you on because Altitude Accelerator supports a lot of startup founders and for them this ends up being a journey that spans a lot of failures, challenge challenges, really amazing moments, but I want them to hear from your perspective. Because you&amp;#8217;ve gone through this multiple times. So let&amp;#8217;s start with the first question. So your journey. Is one that leaps into many of these disparate industries. You had no previous knowledge, really or nor experience in some of these, but you decided to delve into this next thing, which I guess most people would think is incredibly risky, is that is that accurate?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Ryan Pannell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Ohh I don&amp;#8217;t know, I mean it it always seems risky in hindsight. You know, at the time it seems like a good idea and yeah, let&amp;#8217;s just be bold and go do that. And then you look back years later and you think, Oh my God, I can&amp;#8217;t believe that, you know, I did that or we did that. And you know, my my wife and I talked about that a lot. You know, when we we moved to Barbados nine years ago before moving to Switzerland three years ago. And when we moved to Barbados, we thought we were completely prepared, ready to go. New adventure, young kids. This will be awesome. And we like, completely did. Not have the asset. Base that we required to make that move safely, serendipitously. You know, everything changed right after I moved my my career in asset management just skyrocketed. So that saved us. But at the time, I mean, if I had to do it again, knowing then what I know now, I probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t have done it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;But so it seems like you kind of roll with the punches, right. And in your life, would you say, would you say that that is a hallmark of what entrepreneurship is all about, really?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Ryan Pannell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;I&amp;#8217;d say more than rolling with the punches. I&amp;#8217;ve never been afraid. I never say never. I almost never have been afraid to make a change. Change when something that I was involved with before stopped working. You know, a lot of people. I mean we we&amp;#8217;ve got this problem in in society, period, not just in entrepreneurial circles where if you don&amp;#8217;t quote UN quote finish what you start you&amp;#8217;re seen as a failure or a quitter or someone who. Doesn&amp;#8217;t stick it out. Like, but how does it make any sense to continue doing something that&amp;#8217;s not working that&amp;#8217;s not profitable? That&amp;#8217;s not making you happy? Like, if you suddenly realize or or gradually come to the realization that whatever it is you&amp;#8217;re doing is just not going to work. Then every extra minute you spend doing that is a minute wasted and a minute you&amp;#8217;re not doing something else, so that more than rolling with the punches because it&amp;#8217;s not really reactive, it&amp;#8217;s just based on a clinical analysis of where I am, what opportunities exist on the current path versus opportunities that exist. On a new path. Limited opportunities here. Better opportunities over there. OK, what do I have to do to make this change? Let&amp;#8217;s make. The change. Let&amp;#8217;s move on. Let&amp;#8217;s evolve. That&amp;#8217;s sort of how I&amp;#8217;ve approached it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;OK, so let let&amp;#8217;s get into a little bit more specifics because. For each new venture, there has to be have been some kind of catalyst that makes you decide that this is the this is the thing that I want to do. So how how did you decide to approach each of your new ventures? From that perspective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Ryan Pannell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;I mean, sometimes it&amp;#8217;s very reactionary, you know, we were building early just web-based applications. This is before SAS was thing and I was running a software development company and had realized in the. Early part, you know, right after 2000, early part of 2000 into 2000 and. Run that building local software will always carry the inherent problem of conflicts on a local machine, like you can&amp;#8217;t possibly. Predict. The build of every single machine that&amp;#8217;s out there so you know you build the software, you build it to be universally compliant and inevitably you get some client that calls you and says, well, this doesn&amp;#8217;t work or I got this. Error. But you know, even back then we realized that browser based technologies. As long as it. Was compliant with the browser. It was likely going to work. On the system. And so we. Were involved in these early web technologies and after the dot com collapse one of the advantageous things happened. Which happened for in the entrepreneurial space. Base was the collapse of all of these data centers. So, so eBay basically got flooded with cheap enterprise grade technology and so we built, you know, an enormous part of our infrastructure out of failed other dot com companies. You&amp;#8217;re buying these servers that were twenty $30,000 for 1400 bucks. And I had bought some enormous universe of power supply, you know, like a floor unit. And it never showed up. And I knew this guy had received the emails I sent, and he was just messing with me. I called my senior network analyst in and I said this guy&amp;#8217;s lying. I want to prove that he got my E-mail like how do we do that? And he just. Kind of looked at. Me and said, well, you can&amp;#8217;t, you know, like everybody else, I misunderstood how e-mail worked, I thought. You know, goes from my computer to your computer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Not that it goes through, you know, a million servers, you know, including two ISP&amp;#8217;s or multiple ISP&amp;#8217;s that it could fall out of its TLS conduit that you could have a bad collision and the e-mail would never arrive intact. No idea. And I couldn&amp;#8217;t believe that we couldn&amp;#8217;t. Track these communications and so that bad transaction on eBay led me to build what was at the time the most secure electronic file delivery system on the planet. It was like point to point 4096 bit encrypted like we got, we got e-mail, we got even got. Emails we got. Registered mail from government. Agencies warning us not to export the cryptography at that strength, but you know like that was it wasn&amp;#8217;t like I had a love of cryptography and I always wanted to do it. It was a reaction to something that happened. We had the infrastructure to build it. And so that&amp;#8217;s the direction that we went in. And so many of them were were like that, you know, shifting. Shifting from film and television into web-based technologies involved a brief stint. You know in web development, and this is at a time when the the the opening or landing page of a website like the animated landing page is like a big deal with. So. So having this cinematic background. The company that I started built these cinematic opening pages that really drew people in and we won two flash forward. Awards, which was. An award given by Macromedia before Flash got absorbed by by Adobe and that got us a lot of interest, so moving from. Film and television into technology. We just saw that if the future of filmmaking was there. We were deficient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;In the technology side, so we wanted to get. But better educated in that space, always intending to get back to film and television. But it took like 15 years to do that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Oh my goodness. OK, so based on like the the two that that you you&amp;#8217;ve talked about the cryptography, the film industry even before we jump into retail trade where you where you ventured in later on which presented the steepest learning curve. For you and how quickly did you have to adapt?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Ryan Pannell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Actually, maybe, maybe we&amp;#8217;ll just catapult immediately to that. The steepest learning curve was actually trade. And it&amp;#8217;s and it&amp;#8217;s not because trading itself. Was difficult. I mean, I spent time in theoretical physics and applied tech cryptography and studied cosmology and.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Just for fun, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Ryan Pannell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Just for fun. But there&amp;#8217;s some some for work, some for fun. Umm. And while those are subjects that present substantial difficulty, there&amp;#8217;s also enormous resources available, like there are academic centers. There are degrees, there&amp;#8217;s courseware, there&amp;#8217;s self study, there is now obviously an limitless amount of online information from credible. Institution. Where you can self learn, but when it comes to trading, there&amp;#8217;s nothing available. Institutional traders do not post on YouTube, they&amp;#8217;re not active in chat rooms, they&amp;#8217;re not on Twitter, they don&amp;#8217;t have time for any of that. And if they did, they&amp;#8217;re generally. This inclined to share the secrets of their trade. So what you have is a whole cohort of retail trade. Who are disadvantaged by not having any formal education or not really understanding the market mechanics that? Sort of govern how trading works around the world, trying their best to kind of learn what they can make some of it up as they go along, and then you&amp;#8217;ve got a lot of the blind leading the blind. So getting access to the information, understanding what was real and what was absolutely made. Bob. That was the steepest learning curve you know, because unless you know somebody who&amp;#8217;s an institutional trader or portfolio manager. You can&amp;#8217;t find that there is no degree in equity trading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;But I would.

The hidden fees that their broker is charging them. Are doing to their bottom line. There&amp;#8217;s no advantage that I get helping someone understand how to better use the order types that are available to them when placing their trades. Don&amp;#8217;t use a limit order ever. Please don&amp;#8217;t use a market order ever. OK what? Am I supposed? To buy stop limit order like the rest of US professionals. Like that guy&amp;#8217;s now not gonna come and eat my lunch. But who&amp;#8217;s taking the time to provide? That education you. Know. That&amp;#8217;s what I really see is that most financial professionals are like I&amp;#8217;m busy. This is a tough enough job as it is. I&amp;#8217;m not going to take time out and give time to somebody out there who wants to become a better trader. Why bother?

So let&amp;#8217;s, let&amp;#8217;s get to the next question you have this, I would say innate ability to. Yeah. Focus. Has this been, I guess one of the key traits that you consider?

When I started, I had terrible discipline. When I started, you know, I I would get distracted. I spent too much time doing useless, stupid things. Things I would plan for eventualities that were really remote in nature. So the time that I was spending preparing for this probably never going to happen. Event with time I could have better spent doing almost anything else, but I did ultimately realize that you know. A level of discipline and focus was necessary if I wanted to achieve what I wanted to achieve, certainly in the shortest amount of time, right? You know you if you&amp;#8217;re disciplined and focus, you get a lot more out of four hours of focus time in a day than you will out of eight hours of distracted time, you know, and that&amp;#8217;s really the difference. You know, people will say, well, how come you accomplish so much in a day relative to this person or that person is? Because, like, I don&amp;#8217;t waste the same amount of time, I&amp;#8217;m not some robot like I don&amp;#8217;t bang away constantly, no brakes ever. Nobody can do that. I just spent a lot of time figuring out how to structure my day so that I could take advantage of times when I observed I&nbsp; Had the highest energy when times when focus was easier than other times you. Know you, you. Sort of mid afternoon late afternoon. The quality of of your work is deteriorated by that point.

Of your articles that you wrote, it was called 5 under appreciated strategies. For improving performance, so can you elaborate a little bit on that, because I think focus is one of the things but but really it it&amp;#8217;s really about mindset it&amp;#8217;s it&amp;#8217;s about wellness physically as well as mentally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Ryan Pannell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Yeah, I mean. I always found it interesting that when people are looking for a competitive advantage or they&amp;#8217;re looking to improve. Their performance, you know, like one of the first things they do is they pop open like the App Store and they look at, you know, productivity apps or they go to like, you know, life hacks from the perspective. Of can can I can I jog on my under desk treadmill while I listen to podcasts and return emails? Like that&amp;#8217;s that&amp;#8217;s not where your performance is actually going to come from. It&amp;#8217;s there&amp;#8217;s some really low hanging fruit that people consistently ignore. That works for everybody. It&amp;#8217;s free and absolutely makes a difference. And so yeah, in. That article I talk about like. I think number one was. Sleep. I you know people we know. Oh, you should get more sleep. Ohh yeah. You know, I I don&amp;#8217;t get enough sleep. I could use more sleep. I hate catching up my sleep on the way. Everybody knows. It&amp;#8217;s like eating your vegetables. You know, you should do it. But most people don&amp;#8217;t really understand the critical role that sleep plays. In life. Period. Right. I mean. All of your physiological repetitive functions happen when you&amp;#8217;re asleep. That&amp;#8217;s cell repair. That&amp;#8217;s hormone balance. That&amp;#8217;s conversion of short term memory and long term. Memory like if you don&amp;#8217;t get enough sleep, it&amp;#8217;s not like your body will do that at some other time or at a lower level of efficiency. It won&amp;#8217;t do it. So you have like 3 whiskeys and go to bed. Your body will not repair cellular damage, it&amp;#8217;s going to spend the whole night trying to process the toxin that you just ingested. Instead of doing what you needed to do, no short term memory, moving to long term memory, no hormone balance. So you&amp;#8217;re you&amp;#8217;re waking up and you&amp;#8217;re trying to get the most out of your day with a broken down machine. You know, like first thing you can do, it&amp;#8217;s free. Go to sleep earlier. Like, what are you doing after 9:00? And that probably nothing useful watching TV doing scrolling social media. Right. You&amp;#8217;re doing this stuff. That&amp;#8217;s not going to have any meaningful impact on your life to be unconscious. You feel so much better the next day, and because your body was able to do all of the things that it&amp;#8217;s designed to do, everybody&amp;#8217;s body. There is advantage number one, you know caffeine modulation #2, right? The fact that we don&amp;#8217;t get enough sleep habitually leads to caffeine abuse. Not I&amp;#8217;m not someone that that avoids caffeine. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of benefits to caffeine. There&amp;#8217;s benefits to drinking coffee. People don&amp;#8217;t understand what it does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Or how it&amp;#8217;s doing it. You know that your body is producing. This, this adenosine sleep hormone in 24 hour cycles and caffeine stops that hormone from being absorbed and so it&amp;#8217;s stopping it&amp;#8217;s stopping. It&amp;#8217;s stopping but it doesn&amp;#8217;t eliminate it so it&amp;#8217;s bonding to it and it&amp;#8217;s building up building up, building up and eventually when the caffeine degrades, all of that adenosine is released into your system. And that&amp;#8217;s why you feel like exhausted halfway. Through the day. Because now you&amp;#8217;re getting all of it, and that&amp;#8217;s why your afternoon coffee is never as effective as the morning one like you have this afternoon. Coffee. You&amp;#8217;re like, oh, my God, I need this coffee. It will stop new adenosine from being absorbed. But that big tidal wave has already hit you, so now it&amp;#8217;s not doing as much, so you drink more coffee in the afternoon. Now you&amp;#8217;re not going to fall asleep, right? Like I have, like, one to two coffees in the morning. I I have a small coffee, you know, noon, 1:00 and I have nothing for the rest of. The day I don&amp;#8217;t get that lull anymore, which then makes me more efficient, like two, you know? There you go. Sleep and and focus on your caffeine intake.

Biggest risk that I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen in all startups, my own, and others that I&amp;#8217;ve seen not succeed is and an overly high level of optimism combined. With under capitalization like you know I want to start this business. I have some money. It is for sure not enough money, probably, but you think it is. So you know you start the business. And as you you start to blow through this money, you start to make bad decisions. So the bad decisions are commonly you avoid legal services, right? You, you you don&amp;#8217;t send contracts to lawyers, you download them off the Internet. You read them. They seem to be pretty good. You know, you execute them opening yourself with the liability and risk because lawyer fees are really high, even cheap lawyers cost money that you don&amp;#8217;t actually see translating to to revenue, so you won&amp;#8217;t do that. Partners don&amp;#8217;t make partnership agreements in the beginning. Because some part of you knows that you&amp;#8217;re going. To have a. Fight right away and you want to be really positive and you&amp;#8217;re like, we&amp;#8217;re going to. Change the world with this. And you come back around to having that agreement in the future when there&amp;#8217;s actual money on the table. And that&amp;#8217;s a way worse fight to have. So people do things like that. You know, I&amp;#8217;ve got more than enough. I can do this. They&amp;#8217;re undercapitalized, bad decisions, and it just goes down downhill from there, really. And I see that that&amp;#8217;s that&amp;#8217;s 95% of failed startups. I can track back to. Under capitalization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;And I think I think for for a lot of people like you said, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of optimism in the beginning. But then when the decision to actually do things that require money, they don&amp;#8217;t actually happen when they should happen. You know, everybody tries to get it done, like, right at the beginning, like the agreement thing. There, there are lessons in that in that if there were agreement, maybe we could have mitigated this specific risk in the future, right? But that again comes with a cost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Ryan Pannell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Yeah. And it&amp;#8217;s, but it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s not huge. It&amp;#8217;s just something, right, like, you know, it depends on what country you&amp;#8217;re in. But you know, if memory serves Canada, it&amp;#8217;s been a while, but, you know, like $1500 or something, and you&amp;#8217;ve incorporated a company. OK. So I&amp;#8217;ve incorporated a company now the extra. Legal work making sure that that company is set up to run effectively would bring the total startup cost. For admin and legals to maybe 10 grand like, it&amp;#8217;s not a ton of money and now it&amp;#8217;s set up optimally from the beginning. Shareholder agreements are in place. Everything&amp;#8217;s super clear. You start on the right page and if you&amp;#8217;re engaging contractors like you have. Good quality terms and conditions that are. Going to keep. You safe insulated from liability, et cetera like that, plus a bank account. And you&amp;#8217;re ready to go. Ohh and it&amp;#8217;s just you know the it&amp;#8217;s the extra $8500 in legal fees that people think ohh, but that will get me a BCD instead everybody wants to feel like they&amp;#8217;re in business, so they want their website and then with their social channels and they want a cool zoom background or. Whatever it is that they&amp;#8217;re gonna put in place that&amp;#8217;s going to make it seem like they&amp;#8217;re they&amp;#8217;re not like a one man or one gal band.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;And you&amp;#8217;re missing like the part that you are, you can&amp;#8217;t redo that after the fact, like you got one chance to do it. And that&amp;#8217;s the chance to do it, I would say. You know, for me that&amp;#8217;s number one. Number two would be not doing the appropriate amount of research in terms of where your revenue is going to come from. Like you have this great idea, you think it&amp;#8217;s going to change the world based on. Your gut. You know, I&amp;#8217;m going to do this. I&amp;#8217;m sure there&amp;#8217;ll be clients. I&amp;#8217;m sure we&amp;#8217;ll get revenue. Like what? Market analysis have you done? Come to that conclusion if you haven&amp;#8217;t done it, it&amp;#8217;s because you&amp;#8217;re afraid of learning that your dream idea isn&amp;#8217;t a very good idea and you sort of just want to go. Same thing is you haven&amp;#8217;t put a partnership agreement in place, not because you&amp;#8217;re an idiot and you don&amp;#8217;t know that you need it. It&amp;#8217;s because you kind of feel like there might be a fight. And that would just throw cold water on everything. And you&amp;#8217;re so excited and you want to move. Forward with positivity. This is business, right? Like you&amp;#8217;re not gonna be friends forever. You&amp;#8217;re building something together. So take the time to make sure you&amp;#8217;re on the same page. Take the time to make sure that there is a a market for whatever it is you&amp;#8217;re trying to sell, product or service or whatever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt; OK, that&amp;#8217;s cool.

AIP so far that&amp;#8217;s probably I was probably end of June is probably a billion by then we&amp;#8217;ve got another another component, yeah, it&amp;#8217;s been it&amp;#8217;s been good but you know I I think of Kaiju.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;From an entrepreneurial perspective. I couldn&amp;#8217;t have done it at any other point in my life, and not just because AI wasn&amp;#8217;t AI back then. I&amp;#8217;ve been working specifically with AI and portfolio management since 2019. Like back then, people thought I was insane. We were insane for managing portfolios just using AI. But. It&amp;#8217;s worked out really well and it&amp;#8217;s been a very validating like last 18 months to be sure, but. It&amp;#8217;s been a very complicated venture and I lacked. I lacked the knowledge. I lacked the wisdom, I lacked the emotional sophistication I lacked, the managerial experience, you know, I I had to go through the other careers, the other companies, the other businesses. To get to a point where. You know, I could run a company that you know has people in 17 countries and 13 time. Zones like it. Just wasn&amp;#8217;t equipped to do that, wasn&amp;#8217;t equipped to manage that many diverse personalities, requirements, cultures, et cetera, so. You know it&amp;#8217;s it&amp;#8217;s it&amp;#8217;s been a a good journey. It&amp;#8217;s satisfying for me to be able to see. Not not so much the success, but that recognize. In the management of it, I could see that I&amp;#8217;ve I&amp;#8217;ve grown and you know, maybe really slowly, but growth nonetheless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;So you started out, you started out in retail trade and then you and then when you decided that you you wanted to create this company for a long time, it was just you and your and a partner or two for for a very long time before you decided to to build up the company, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Ryan Pannell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Well, sort of I I started. Very briefly, in retail trading, a couple of colleagues that I&amp;#8217;d spent some time with. Who were also theoretical physicists had gone off to work at a big sell side bank in England and contacted me. From a quantitative perspective like hey, you know more and more banks, this is like 22,000 and twelve 2013, something like that. You know, banks are sort of hiring us more and more. And I was the pattern recognition specialist because I&amp;#8217;ve spent so much time in applied cryptography and. That&amp;#8217;s really all it is. You know, can you look at some data for us? Can you tell us if you? See anything there? I looked, I knew how to trade before, just recreationally, and I I I did see exploitable patterns and I I shared those with them the first couple of times and then realized that maybe I should stop sharing them. And so I I I started a small account. I built a number of trading systems. I started trading. That was very. Successful and through a mutual friend, I came to the attention of someone who was at the time Europe&amp;#8217;s largest fund manager. And they very kindly and and different people in their in their. Management company mentored me. I became a portfolio manager. They&amp;#8217;re institutional trader and then portfolio manager. And then in a very short amount of time. The same person said you need your own fund. You need to you need this is you need to be managing your own fund. So help me set up my first hedge fund and my first fund management company. And yeah, I had. I had some seconded staff from his company and it was like me and. Four other three other three other guys, you know, all working in technology, right? Like I, I I needed professional technologists to help build the proprietary systems that I wanted to build, like an architect them, but I couldn&amp;#8217;t build them as. And you know from from there, we grew from those forty people to, you know, it&amp;#8217;s almost 50 and from, you know, a couple of countries to 17 and from managing 1 little hedge fund to several funds to building IP to launching products on the New York Stock Exchange. We&amp;#8217;re all using artificial intelligence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;We knew that we wanted to go that direction. It just wasn&amp;#8217;t accessible at our size and capital base until about 20-19 and then we. Had enough expertise on staff, we had enough capital and we, the technology itself, had become more accessible and we could really make a go of predictive AI, obviously not, not generative AI, which is the world&amp;#8217;s worst fund management ChatGPT. What what? What&amp;#8217;s not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let&amp;#8217;s let&amp;#8217;s get into the technology itself because, because you you&amp;#8217;ve already mentioned that you don&amp;#8217;t have any. I guess I wouldn&amp;#8217;t say faith or confidence within what what&amp;#8217;s going on with with the. LM&amp;#8217;s, and and I can curl with that right now in this nascent. Base it&amp;#8217;s not there, but from your perspective, when it comes to actually developing artificial intelligence within within your industry, you know there are a lot out there that that that do what similar to what you can do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Ryan Pannell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;No, there&amp;#8217;s really there&amp;#8217;s really, there&amp;#8217;s almost none. I mean, it&amp;#8217;s an unforgiving on ramp the the sort of grandfather of all of it was Renaissance Technologies is Renaissance technologies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s that was run by the the late great Jim Simons, who was an incredibly gifted geometer. And he started this hedge fund when he was, you know, 45 or 46. And, you know, for 30 years they&amp;#8217;ve they&amp;#8217;ve delivered like 67% returns net of all fees every year. But their employee owned like and have been for decades. They&amp;#8217;re closed, so they they basically perfected systematic and quantitative trading. Went into early machine learning artificial intelligence application. Means used to have outside capital a long time ago and then kicked everybody out once they had enough of their own money and just run on that so that their medallion fund is, you know, 10 to $12 billion. That&amp;#8217;s all employee owned. Nobody&amp;#8217;s ever. Gets any information out of that shop because again, employee owned right? It it. It has the distinction of having the highest number of millionaire receptionists in the world, right? If you&amp;#8217;re, if you&amp;#8217;re making 67% after all fees every year, are you talking to anyone? No, of course not. So, you know, 30 years, we know, like, three things about them. You know their win win rate is slightly better than 50. Percent, which means that their asymmetrical return on risk is enormous. We know that they only trade in a three to eight day window, which substantiates all of our findings that predictive AI and in capital markets trading is only effective in the very immediate terms, not crystal ball. It&amp;#8217;s not going to tell you where something going to be in six months. That&amp;#8217;s that&amp;#8217;s ridiculous. Uhm. And and that they only have there like 297 scientists and five traders, right. And and that mirrors sort of us, we&amp;#8217;re smaller, but yeah, we have a we. Have. 8% of our workforce, 7% of our workforce are traders. Everybody else is a scientist. And you still need the traders. You know, the scientists themselves. The machines themselves don&amp;#8217;t come up with very novel, innovative, workable solutions. You know, the traders still. Have to execute. Trades and some some asset classes et cetera and so. For what we. Do with predictive AI. Yeah, I see. A huge future. There but there. Or. There aren&amp;#8217;t a lot of companies that are doing it. Citadel, absolutely, but they don&amp;#8217;t talk about it like the companies that aren&amp;#8217;t doing it are not talking about. They&amp;#8217;re not sharing the technology. All the attention is on generative AI as an asset manager and analyst or whatever, and it&amp;#8217;s terrible, you know, for all of the reasons I&amp;#8217;m sure you&amp;#8217;ve you&amp;#8217;ve covered many, many times has. Like it&amp;#8217;s there&amp;#8217;s no standardized data, there&amp;#8217;s no verifiable source of truth versus what we do is ingest like price, time and quantity data and look for repeating patterns very different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;So are you. Who now I think within your industry that the you you create a lot of efficiencies for your company and. Like you said. You your you have a workforce that is probably a fraction of some of the some, some of the most successful ones out there. Where do you see the future of AI when it comes to this? I mean, replaceable job is a. Is a big. Is a big newsworthy item right now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Ryan Pannell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Yeah, I think you know if if you&amp;#8217;re a systematic or quantitative trader, yeah, I think you&amp;#8217;re done. I think you&amp;#8217;re done now, right. I mean, these systems, the types that we&amp;#8217;re building and using, they&amp;#8217;re ingesting the entire stock market at the trade level like what we call it, the print level, every single trade is being ingested. Analyzed in real time simultaneous. Obviously it&amp;#8217;s billions of transactions before any one of our systems makes a trade management decisions. It&amp;#8217;s billions of discrete examinations simultaneously before it makes the decision. We can&amp;#8217;t do that we&amp;#8217;re it&amp;#8217;s not capable of that level of analysis. So it&amp;#8217;s going to replace those, those traders, but it can&amp;#8217;t do. Everything. It&amp;#8217;s there&amp;#8217;s global macro. Forget it. It&amp;#8217;s there&amp;#8217;s no system in the world that&amp;#8217;s going to say. Well, I think that Putin&amp;#8217;s going to invade Ukraine and I think this will be the socioeconomic fallout from that. And I think this will be the flow through of that fallout into capital markets. Like, no chance that requires, you know, a person with deep experience. And even then, they&amp;#8217;re they&amp;#8217;re they&amp;#8217;re gonna be right. Like 30% of the time. So it&amp;#8217;s not gonna do that. I don&amp;#8217;t think anybody wants to take investment management advice from a machine which it&amp;#8217;s not built that way. We&amp;#8217;re a human. Human species. So I think we like that the investment manager has access to tools that will optimize decision making that can increase performance, decrease risk, can maybe act as an early warning signal in turbulent times. But we still don&amp;#8217;t want, you know, to input all of our data and have a machine. Say, here&amp;#8217;s your portfolio or this is what? You should do there&amp;#8217;s. A small or that probably does. But that&amp;#8217;s, you know, I like you, Hesse. I think that I think there&amp;#8217;s no question AI is the technology of the future, but. The propensity of of purveyors to say that it can do everything and will replace everything is just absurd, and it it belies a lack of understanding and the of the technology itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Yeah, I I mean I I was speaking to somebody yesterday about this existential threat that everybody had talks about.

Both from the wall. And it it, it won&amp;#8217;t subsist itself. Then I said that that&amp;#8217;s the only time that I think we&amp;#8217;ll be at risk.

I want to move into. Your interest in philanthropy, because you&amp;#8217;ve been doing this even you know, as an entrepreneur. For, for, for. A very long time.

I mean I I I think that they as diverse as they are, I think that they&amp;#8217;re they&amp;#8217;re both sort of rooted in the same ideology which is an investment in the future, right, I mean you. Know. We came from the. 70% of our oxygen comes from the ocean. We can&amp;#8217;t exist on this planet without a healthy ocean, and we just treat it like a giant toilet, right. And everything from shark finning, which takes out an apex predator which then sends the food chain into decay. That ends with the destruction of phytoplankton and diatoms, which which are these organisms that create the oxygen? Right. You kill the sharks. We&amp;#8217;re just going to suffocate, right? And there&amp;#8217;s there&amp;#8217;s just not a lot of education. Much like the sleep and the vegetables and the too much coffee and the whiskey before bed. Like, you know, you&amp;#8217;re not supposed to do it. Nobody&amp;#8217;s like, yeah. Hey, I&amp;#8217;ll throw this plastic right into the ocean, but we sort of turn a blind eye to it because we don&amp;#8217;t know what happens. General, I&amp;#8217;m talking about general populace. What happens when it gets there so, you know, microplastics are not something that. A wonder kids, big ocean cleanup ship is going to fix like I completely applaud everyone of those initiatives. Yes, that&amp;#8217;s the start. But microplastics are not caught by that sieve, right? And they are in every piece of seafood that you ingest contains plastics in North America, 90% of kids under 6. Have microplastics in their system system. Our bodies not designed to deal with this. It&amp;#8217;s never seen it before. It&amp;#8217;s kind of like trans fats, right? We don&amp;#8217;t have the capacity to just be like, oh, that&amp;#8217;s cool. I just break that down and deal with it so. So you know, where do you start education? You know, connecting people with the ocean. I&amp;#8217;ve always been a big Waterman surfing stand up paddling, diving free diving, scuba diving, sailing, boating, whatever it is like, I&amp;#8217;m happiest, you know, on in or under the water. And if I can support. Programs that put people who are interested in at that level of connection. Tivity. Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s it&amp;#8217;s. It&amp;#8217;s like, you know, animal lovers. It&amp;#8217;s really difficult to be awful to animals if you&amp;#8217;re exposed to them on a regular basis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Speaker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Like you know, you learn their individual personalities. You know what makes them so wonderful, et cetera. So that&amp;#8217;s on the ocean front. That&amp;#8217;s part of the future. And then in terms of underprivileged youth, same thing, right, I mean technology these days is relatively cheap. You know you got an, you know, a Kindle Fire tablet, previous generation iPad, any, any number of tablets that you can use. That you can distribute to school kids. Most schools have free Wi-Fi connectivity even in Second World countries, and that connects them to education. It connects them to information. Limitless amounts of information. So that&amp;#8217;s where some kid that has no access to learning more about robotics can learn all they feel like learning about robotics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;And you know how much is 199 bucks a kid? Something like that. They&amp;#8217;re going to my experience doing this for years is that they cherish the. These, these these tools I&amp;#8217;ve I&amp;#8217;ve never handed out a tablet to some kid and they just, like, throw it on the ground. You know, this is like, yeah, fine. They can play games on it. I don&amp;#8217;t care if they play games on it. They&amp;#8217;re they&amp;#8217;re using it. They&amp;#8217;re developing skill with the tablet. They&amp;#8217;re connecting online, you know. Back when they&amp;#8217;re handing these out roadblocks is like a big deal for these kids, right? And you can program for that game. So they&amp;#8217;re getting access to programming, you know, doing. Free courseware on that, so that&amp;#8217;s. You know, to each their own. But that&amp;#8217;s those are areas.

I think so. I mean, you know, you alluded to it a little bit earlier in terms of the next chapter like I would love to you know create. Like a Khan Academy, but for financial literacy. And that&amp;#8217;s sort of always been my goal, right? I mean, it&amp;#8217;s it&amp;#8217;s ridiculous that, you know, we get exposed to plant biology in school and there&amp;#8217;s not a single financial literacy course like, you have no idea how the mortgage payments that will govern your life, the credit card. Payments that can destroy your. Life credit debt tax, like nobody teaches this.

You know this interest versus principal versus the term, there&amp;#8217;s variable or fixed rate. I don&amp;#8217;t understand any of this. Help me out. You&amp;#8217;re going to nod their head.

Well, now iPad like tablet, phone, laptop, desktop library, computer. You can sign up for a free account. You can fix this yourself in private without ever talking to anybody. And I love that. And I would love to be able to do the same thing for financial literacy. You have no idea how your credit card works. You don&amp;#8217;t know these terms. Cool. Here&amp;#8217;s the little course.

							&lt;p&gt;The rise of large language models (LLMs) has significantly changed how we communicate, conduct research, and enhance our productivity, ultimately transforming society as we know it. LLMs are exceptionally skilled in natural language understanding and generating language that seems more accurate and human-like than their predecessor. However, they also pose new risks to data privacy and the security of personal information. Compared to narrow AI systems with LLMs, more complex issues like sophisticated phishing attacks, manipulation of online content, and breaches in privacy controls are emerging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent&nbsp;&lt;a class="color-link" title="https://mixmode.ai/blog/global-cybercrime-report-2024-which-countries-face-the-highest-risk/" href="https://mixmode.ai/blog/global-cybercrime-report-2024-which-countries-face-the-highest-risk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://mixmode.ai/blog/global-cybercrime-report-2024-which-countries-face-the-highest-risk/" aria-label="study by MixMode"&gt;study by MixMode&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;analyzed data from the National Cyber Security Index (NCSI), the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), the Cybersecurity Exposure Index (CEI), and findings from Comparitech to assess cyber safety across 70 countries.&nbsp;&lt;a class="color-link" title="https://mixmode.ai/blog/global-cybercrime-report-2024-which-countries-face-the-highest-risk/" href="https://mixmode.ai/blog/global-cybercrime-report-2024-which-countries-face-the-highest-risk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://mixmode.ai/blog/global-cybercrime-report-2024-which-countries-face-the-highest-risk/" aria-label="Findings"&gt;Findings&lt;/a&gt; indicate that countries with the most robust cybersecurity infrastructures include Finland, Norway, and Denmark. The United Kingdom, Sweden, Japan, and the United States also maintain strong defenses against cyber threats.

							&lt;p&gt;Worrisome are the countries that pose the highest risk for cyber-attacks. The threat exposure in these emerging countries includes the economic impact of potential financial losses for both public and private sectors, the threat to national security systems, particularly their vulnerability to cyber espionage, and attacks on critical infrastructure and national safety. These countries, more prone to data breaches, face the exposure of highly sensitive information, leading to identity theft, financial fraud, increased sources of cybercrime, and eroded investor and consumer confidence.&lt;/p&gt;						&lt;/div&gt;

Publicly reported data compromises rose by 78% year-over-year. The average cost of a data breach hit an all-time high last year at $4.45 million, marking a 15% increase from three years ago. Notably, 90% of organizations experienced at least one third-party vendor suffering a data breach. Globally, the number of victims in 2023 doubled compared to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saima Fancy explained that the driving force behind these issues is the intense desire for data collection by organizations, often resulting in reckless behavior. Technologies like OpenAI, she indicated, are launched prematurely to maximize data collection. &amp;#8220;These technologies are often released too early by design,&amp;#8221; she noted, &amp;#8220;to accumulate as much data as possible. While they appear free, they&amp;#8217;re not truly free because you&amp;#8217;re providing your personal data, essential for training their models.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that organizations could have opted to legally acquire data and train their models in a structured manner. &amp;#8220;Many tools were ready but weren&amp;#8217;t launched immediately because they were undergoing rigorous sandboxing and validation testing,&amp;#8221; she explained, noting the rush to release new technologies isn’t always deliberate but often fueled by enthusiasm and the pressure to innovate, which can lead to unintended consequences. &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s a race to release new technologies, which can inadvertently cause harm. It&amp;#8217;s often just a case of &amp;#8216;let&amp;#8217;s release it and see what happens.'&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fancy also highlighted that many of these tools are rarely stable in their nascent form, and developers will fine-tune the models over time. &amp;#8220;This means the initial outputs might not be accurate or what users expect. Despite this ongoing learning phase, these tools are already live on a global scale,&amp;#8221; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LLMs and the Indiscriminate Scraping of PII&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that LLMs have been developed from data gathered indiscriminately across web properties there&amp;#8217;s a risk of exposing sensitive details such as credentials, API keys, and other confidential information. Fancy believes that society’s susceptibility to security threats is unprecedented, observing, &amp;#8220;The public is undoubtedly more vulnerable now than ever before. We&amp;#8217;re in the fifth industrial revolution, where generative AI is a relatively new phenomenon. As these tools are released publicly without adequate user education, the risk skyrockets. People input sensitive data like clinical notes into tools like chat GPT, not realizing that once their personal information is entered, they’re used to train models. This can lead to their data being potentially re-identified if they’re not properly protected.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She emphasized the risk extends beyond individual users to corporations as well, particularly if employees are not properly trained in using these technologies, including prompt engineering. &amp;#8220;The vulnerability is extremely high, and for corporations, the risk is even greater because they risk losing public trust and they are not immune to data breaches. As these tools evolve, so do the techniques of malicious actors, who use them to refine their ransomware and phishing attacks, making these threats more sophisticated and costly to mitigate.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we are witnessing the swift emergence of regulation through the&nbsp;&lt;a class="color-link" title="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/" href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/" aria-label="EU AI Act"&gt;EU AI Act&lt;/a&gt;, the most comprehensive legislation on AI and the Biden&nbsp;&lt;a class="color-link" title="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/" aria-label="Executive Order on Safe Secure and Trustworthy AI"&gt;Executive Order on Safe Secure and Trustworthy AI&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;in late 2023. Sahil Agarwal, CEO of&nbsp;&lt;a class="color-link" title="https://www.enkryptai.com/" href="https://www.enkryptai.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.enkryptai.com/" aria-label="Enkrypt AI"&gt;Enkrypt AI&lt;/a&gt;, points out, “Since the introduction of ChatGPT, there has been a significant increase in awareness among the public, legislators, and companies about the potential risks of AI. This heightened awareness has surpassed much of what we&amp;#8217;ve seen over the past decade, highlighting both the potential and the dangers of AI technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that the regulatory mandates are clear and if you’re handling customer data or distributing tools you need to be mindful and ensure these tools aren’t used for harmful purposes. As well, the penalties don’t randomly apply to any startup working with generative AI technology, instead he continues, “ &amp;#8230;they’re targeted at specific stage of a company’s development and certain types of general-purpose AI technologies, emphasizing, they’re there to guide more responsible innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Attacks are More Advanced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s AI technology can enable highly convincing phishing emails or messages that may appear legitimate and trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. In addition, LLMs have enabled attackers to conduct more effective social engineering attacks by generating personalized messages or responses based on more extensive knowledge of the target’s online activity, their preferences and behaviors. We’ve also seen a rise in malicious content as LLMs can be used to generate fake news articles or reviews, which, in turn, can spread misinformation, manipulate public opinion or propagate malware. The speed at which LLMS can also automate certain stages of cyber-attacks by generating targeted queries, crafting exploit payloads, or bypassing security measures, is making it increasingly difficult to identify these before they’re implemented. In addition, the rise of adversarial networks can now manipulate the inputs to generate outputs with intention to deceive spam filters, fraud and malware detection systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fancy explained that both personal and commercial levels are affected and that many systems are vulnerable due to outdated technology or inadequate security measures during transitions to cloud or hybrid systems. Startups often overlook security and privacy measures, which is a clear oversight, revealing, &amp;#8220;From a privacy-by-design perspective, being proactive rather than reactive is crucial. Starting with security measures early in the software development life cycle is essential to prevent sophisticated attacks that can severely impact institutions like banks and hospitals.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She emphasized the naive thinking many startups have, believing they’re immune to attacks adding, &amp;#8220;But what LLMs have done is dramatically broaden the attack landscape, making it easier for malicious actors to observe and eventually exploit vulnerabilities in a company&amp;#8217;s systems. It’s crucial for businesses, especially startups, to prioritize funding for security measures from the outset to protect against these threats. Regulations are also becoming more stringent globally, which could have severe repercussions for non-compliance.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agarwal revealed his team has uncovered some serious safety issues and vulnerabilities with the top LLMs and agrees that perhaps these models are not ready for prime time. “Traditionally, cybersecurity and standard Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions have focused on monitoring specific keywords or personally identifiable information (PII) exiting the network. However, with the advent of generative AI, the landscape has shifted towards extensive in-context data processing.” He states that DLPs now should be tuned to the context of activities or potential security threats occurring, rather than just monitoring data outflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agarwal added the need for safe adoption of these updated AI systems has yet to develop standard practices mainly because of the nascency of LLMs, “While many discuss the concept of responsible adoption, the specifics of implementing, measuring risks, and safeguarding against potential issues when using large language models and other generative technologies in businesses have not been fully established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Irony of AI Safety Amid the Reauthorization of Section 702, FISA into Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent passage of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) into law has created this dichotomy that exists within the same U.S. government that has also mandated the development of trustworthy artificial intelligence. The law was established in 1978 to spy on foreign individuals, underwent significant changes after 9/11, allowing the broad sweeping of U.S. citizens&amp;#8217; information without a warrant. This practice, known as &amp;#8220;&lt;a class="color-link" title="https://www.eff.org/pages/Incidental-collection" href="https://www.eff.org/pages/Incidental-collection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.eff.org/pages/Incidental-collection" aria-label="incidental collection"&gt;incidental collection&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; meant that if such information was obtained, it would still be allowed. Key events include the 2013 revelations by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who&nbsp;&lt;a class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hessiejones/2024/04/23/government-overreach-the-threat-to-civil-liberties-the-contested-extension-of-fisa-section-702/?sh=3f1017cb4d8e" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hessiejones/2024/04/23/government-overreach-the-threat-to-civil-liberties-the-contested-extension-of-fisa-section-702/?sh=3f1017cb4d8e" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/hessiejones/2024/04/23/government-overreach-the-threat-to-civil-liberties-the-contested-extension-of-fisa-section-702/?sh=3f1017cb4d8e" aria-label="exposed the PRISM program"&gt;exposed the PRISM program&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and the involvement of major tech companies like Google and Facebook (at the time) in giving the government unfettered access to user data. This bulk collection of U.S. citizens&amp;#8217; emails, mobile communications, and phone records was later ruled unconstitutional. Despite added provisions to increase oversight and minimize incidental collection, the law was renewed without amendments, resulting in more powerful surveillance capabilities than those considered during the initial AI hype eight years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fancy expressed the regrettable development of this renewal for companies that collect data and create models. “With laws like this being renewed for another two years, the implications are huge. Federal governments can compel companies to hand over data on a span of the population, which is essentially surveillance at another level. This is scary for regular folks and is justified under the guise of world state protection. It may seem necessary at face value, but it opens doors wide for abuse on a larger scale. It is unfortunate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may seem there is no way out of this mandate, companies like Signal and Proton claim they cannot access user data due to end-to-end encryption technology, which allows only users access to their own information. Could this absolve companies of their responsibility amidst the renewed government compliance? Fancy acknowledged, “There are data vaults where customers can store their data, and the company only works with the metadata. These vaults are locked and encrypted, accessible only by the customer. Blockchain technology is another method, where users hold the keys to their data. These methods can protect user data, but they also limit the company&amp;#8217;s ability to monetize the data. Nonetheless, they are valid use cases for protecting user information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Startups Need to be Proactive: Data Privacy and Security Should not be an Afterthought&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agarwal is adamant that innovation should not come at a human cost. He argues that startups creating technologies with potential adverse effects on customers need to integrate ethical guidelines, safety, security and reliability measures from the early development stages, adding, “We cannot adopt a wait-and-see approach, scaling up technology like GPT-4o to widespread use and only then addressing issues reactively. It&amp;#8217;s not sufficient to start implementing safety measures only after noticing misuse. Proactive incorporation of these safeguards is crucial to prevent harm and ensure responsible use from the start.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fancy emphasized that many out-of-the-box tools are available in the market to help companies implement new security measures within their cloud infrastructure. Whether it&amp;#8217;s a private or public cloud, these tools can manage data sets, create their own cloud classifications, categorize and bucket data for protection, and constantly monitor for infractions, loopholes, or openings within the cloud structure. However, she acknowledged that these tools are not readily affordable and require investment upfront as data is being brought in, whether unstructured or structured. As per Fancy, “It&amp;#8217;s crucial for companies to know where their data is located, as many big data companies admit to not knowing which data centers their data resides in, posing a significant risk.” Fancy also pointed out the importance of encryption, both for data at rest and in transit. Often, companies focus only on encrypting data at rest, however she points out, “&amp;#8230;infractions frequently occur when data is traveling between data centers or from a desktop to a data center. You&amp;#8217;ve got to make sure the encryption is happening there as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She highlighted that we are in a favorable time of technological evolution, with many tools available to enhance data security. While these tools&amp;#8217; costs are decreasing, it&amp;#8217;s still necessary for companies to allocate funds for privacy and security measures right from the start. &amp;#8220;As your funding is coming in, you&amp;#8217;ve got to set some money aside to be mindful of doing that,&amp;#8221; Fancy stated. Unlike major companies that can absorb the impact of regulatory actions, small startups must be proactive in their security measures to avoid severe consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Startups, however, can initiate other measures to protect data privacy and security. Fancy suggests smaller startups should practice data minimization, ”and practice collecting data for the purpose that the data was collected. They can put robust consent management measures and audit logging in place that allows startups to manage logs effectively and monitor access controls to see who has access to the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fancy noted that there are healthy mechanisms and practices within data ecosystems that startups can adopt to enhance their security measures. She stated, “These practices can be a viable alternative for startups that cannot afford comprehensive security tools initially.” Startups could start with smaller features of these tools and expand their capabilities as their funds grow. By adopting these practical measures, startups can effectively enhance their data security and privacy protection without incurring significant initial costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethics is Now Mainstream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where technology, compliance and brand risk collide is within the realization that the most compelling technology to date, brought to the masses by Open AI, the darling of large language models, heavily venture capital backed –is&nbsp;&lt;a class="color-link" title="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/openais-gpt-seriously-flawed-panagiotis-loutraris/" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/openais-gpt-seriously-flawed-panagiotis-loutraris/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/openais-gpt-seriously-flawed-panagiotis-loutraris/" aria-label="still flawed"&gt;still flawed&lt;/a&gt;. Agarwal reveals when he recently spoke to a principle from private equity firm, they were experiencing a major scandal when articles they produced were leaked due to their decision to remove certain safeguards. He stressed, “This incident highlights that ethical considerations are not just about morality; they&amp;#8217;ve become crucial to maintaining a brand&amp;#8217;s integrity. Companies are motivated to uphold ethical standards not solely for altruism but also to mitigate brand risks. This need for robust controls is why topics like generative AI security are gaining prominence. At events like the RSA conference, you&amp;#8217;ll find that one of the central themes is either developing security solutions for AI or employing AI to enhance security measures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Security Needs to be in Lock-Step with Advancing AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reauthorization of Section 702 of FISA underscores a significant tension between the pursuit of advanced AI technologies and the imperative of safeguarding data privacy. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into various aspects of our lives, the potential for sophisticated cyber-attacks and the erosion of individual privacy grows. Saima Fancy and Sahil Agarwal emphasize the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures, ethical guidelines, and proactive regulatory compliance to mitigate these risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting AI innovation while ensuring data privacy and security presents a complex challenge prompting organizations to balance the benefits of cutting-edge technologies with the responsibility of protecting sensitive information. Ensuring AI safety, maintaining public trust, and adhering to evolving regulation and security standards are essential to responsible innovation. It’s early day but we’re already seeing organizations take the crucial steps to prioritize security and ethical considerations to foster a safer and more trustworthy world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note this article originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hessiejones/2024/05/31/will-llm-adoption-demand-more-stringent-data-security-measures/?sh=34cfecf34f85"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;						&lt;/div&gt;

And today we&amp;#8217;re talking about large language models. OEM&amp;#8217;s, as they&amp;#8217;re called, have emerged as one of the most powerful and most versatile artificial intelligence technologies of our time. So by training these massive neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On these vast data sets that that are human generated text, LMS are now ones that have developed this unprecedented ability to actually generate human like language and with robust fluency. And I would say comprehension. So this breakthrough has really unlocked a wide range of innovation and applications across many industries. But right now we&amp;#8217;re seeing things like content creation, language, translation and data analytics, conversational AI assistance, and even code generation. More recently, open AI released ChatGPT 4 O they say that it can reason across different modalities in real time, so they train this single model end to end across text vision and audio, meaning that all the inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. So it&amp;#8217;s still early day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this idea of developing a multimodal model has this potential to actually create more effective outputs and you will better decision making in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So welcome to Tech Uncensored that the nacency of the technology has yet to be fully really understood – text, language, and audio understanding the generation capabilities that can drive substantial productivity gains and enable new forms of human and machine collaboration, and even question whether human jobs are replaceable–This is all still emerging so as well LM technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently have limitations. They have risks they have Issues when it comes to factual inaccuracies, they have biases that we&amp;#8217;ve seen in the old guard of AI, from training data, they lack common sense reasoning, and this is pervasive potential for misuse and more recently the data privacy implications. As we&amp;#8217;ve seen from open AI&amp;#8217;s unconsented use of Scarlett Johansson&amp;#8217;s voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there are techniques out there like retrieval augmented generation, which some of the lot of the researchers call rag and they are highlighted as promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coaches to help ground the LM knowledge and improve their accuracies over time, so I am so pleased to welcome Amir Feizpour, CEO and founder of AI Science, which is a platform to for expert in the loop business workflow automation, and I&amp;#8217;ve known emir for many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he is just the right person to actually take us through everything about LLM&amp;#8217;s, and we&amp;#8217;ll cover the transformative impacts of this technology across the different sectors, the applications of both present and future. What are the risks and challenges to LMS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what does this mean for startups actually developing in this space? So welcome Amir.&lt;/p&gt;						&lt;/div&gt;

I’m excited about our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s start with you, because you’ve been doing artificial intelligence for a while. So why don’t you take us through your background you’ve also developed this amazing community of researchers and developers all over the world that have done some amazing collaborations in this space. Tell us how tell us how this all started and why you are here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds good. So just to give you that, I guess your audience a quick history, I am a quantum physicist, planning I I did my whole academic journey of PhD in postdoc and all those good things. But at some point I decided to move to industry and the very first thing I tried was a quantum tech company. And you know, about a decade ago that was just too early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I decided that the next best thing was AI, and very much immediately fell in love with natural language processing because the ability to do computation on text was just crazy to me at the time, and you know when I saw it, I was like, what is this? How can I make my life about it? And you know, that’s what I’ve been trying to do since I worked as a data scientist and then later a product person at one of the financial institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a fun gig, but you know, it was pretty bored at my corporate job. I think the part of being an entrepreneur was in me and one thing that I started doing on the side to entertain myself, but also to keep up with the rate at which information was being released in the space of AI was to build this community like and it literally started by a bunch of us gathering every week, eating pizza and talking about AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, that was six years ago and that’s still going on now. We gather online obviously in a post pandemic world, but the same type of vibe still exists. We hang out every week talking about advances in AI build together, learn from each other and teach each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How big is your community at this point?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we have more than 5000 AI researchers and engineers globally, depending on how you count, but that’s, you know, one of the metrics that we have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you. So let’s dive into LM’s right now we have the current limitations of, I guess, machine learning and whether or not I guess that’s now considered passe. Does anybody say machine learning anymore?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So then then it’s true, then it’s still here. So is it safe to say that LLM’s are a natural evolution within the artificial intelligence space? And so tell me how they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, definitely. So I mean when it comes to artificial intelligence, you know, one of the one of the very critical signs of intelligence is language use, right? Like if the if you look at the animal Kingdom, you know, we are one of the animals that has a very, very complex capability of using language and there’s some aspects of language like a storytelling is specifically tied to cognitive revolution that happened to, you know, homophobia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so you know, as modern humans, we’ve been very, very interested in replicating that capability machines. Right. So like from fifty 60s, when we were interested in expert systems, we always wanted to say how can it talk back to me, how can it understand what I’m saying? Right. And, you know, obviously the.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress has been very, very slow but finally you know language models are like the large language models, like language models have been around for more than people probably realize. But the large ones have been around for the past three to four years, and they just completely, you know, brought the game to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which wasn’t a step function, changed like it was a gradual change over the past, you know, 3:00 to 5:00.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s but, but yeah, definitely they have brought the game of modeling language to A to a very different level, although you know to to address what you said earlier, they don’t necessarily replace a lot of the other types of machine learning that we’ve been doing like they’re not necessarily good at time series forecasting and recommender systems and reinforcement learning. All of those other types of machine learning that we have been doing. So, they are like their own category that potentially interfaces with all other types of intelligence categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, So what? What specifically differs about them in terms of the technologies that they use?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there there are two important differences with with other types of machine learning technologies that we have developed previously. One is just the sheer amount of data they’re trained on. Like I mean a lot of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, previous types of machine learning that we have done. We usually had like a limited amount of data like it was the the largest data sets were the transaction data within this enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or variations of that idea, right? Or or the watch time of YouTube videos. It was usually like super specific and narrow in terms of what the data was and what we could do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With it but with language because of the variants that it has because of the abundance that it has, especially with the Internet, we have just so much data to train on, so that’s one aspect that is very different. So the amount of available data that will still needed to clean it and turn it into high quality training data. But just the amount of available data was so large, which in turn allowed us to train very, very, very large models and these are pure enormous models and only very few entities can train, at least with the current architectures that we have, so that that’s one aspect that we just see the size, the size of the data, the size of the model itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second aspect of it is you know what it is trying to do. So the previous types of machine learning that we were interested in, they were generally speaking, single track ponies if you wish. Right. They’re they’re what we call narrow AI. So they’re capable of giving you a bunch of data points about market predict where the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going by the time series forecasting for the market or I show you what kind of videos Amir has watched, recommend what he would be interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch next, right? But with language models we are doing something slightly different, which is we’re saying, Here is all the text from the Internet and all the code and all the data sets that exist on the Internet. Learn what’s the likelihood of if I give you these few words, what’s the likelihood of the next word and just learn this about the whole Internet. Right. And that’s interesting because all that we are teaching it is if you see text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the most likely next piece of text. If you see data, this is the most likely next piece of data. If you see code, this is the most likely that. That’s sort of idea. That’s what we call autoregressive training and and once it learned that it was large enough that all of a sudden it just code on code internalize a lot of patterns that existed in this. So that’s why it can just connect the dots and be like I wouldn’t write an article that sounds like Hessie Jones wrote it. I want to write an article that is like. I don’t know Harry Potter, but Barack Obama wrote it right? So you can just extrapolate from all of these different places into doing it, doing the tasks that we’re having to do. There are a bunch of other nuances like instruction, find that we can get into, but that that’s really those, those two are the biggest differences versus the more traditional machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the one thing I want you to address is this idea that generative adversarial networks with that, because that that is that considered a a big component of this as well. In being able to generate this coherent text or outputs is Gans part of that solution?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So gens were sort of the baby steps towards generative models, like the even the image based games mostly were used in image space just to generate images and even the early versions of them. They were pretty decent. But you know, they have a lot of problems and the current models do not use that Gan architecture anymore like there are diffusion based in text we you know, the conceptual idea, which is I’m going to give you a bunch of things and generate some result. And I will tell you what is good and what is bad. And the same idea does exist here. And you know the whole red teaming thing for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is an example of sort of that idea taken and, you know, changed a little to say that you’re a large language model. You’re is responsible to generate. I’m going to try my best to break you, try your best to, you know, undo that, right. So that that’s sort of where these sort of conceptual ideas overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so just for our audience, the idea of red teaming it is sort of a way to to create more accountabilities in the systems by by by trying to, I guess from from the outset, almost like fool, fool, fool. The network. Is that right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, essentially, you know you want your large language model to behave in a certain way. The idea of red teaming is like, you know, the training. Like you’re a boxer. That’s the training you do. Like you. You throw the boxer into a ring with somebody else. And you say just fight. You know, the goal is to, you know, make sure that your, you know, Boxer gets really good at predicting what kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, punches are going to come towards them and you know be good at reacting to those. That’s exactly the same thing you’re doing with Dell and you’re going to say this is going to be in the wild. People are going to interact with it. You have no idea what they’re going to do. So let’s try all these ideas. Ask it to do all sorts of crazy things and make sure that the system is robust and can handle those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, so let’s let’s talk with some of the big players here. We have anthropic. We have Gemini from Google, we have Lama from Meta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we have open AI like why do you think at this stage there has been so much interest in even adoption for these large language models?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use cases remarkable, right? Like the the number the number of use cases that rely on on a structured text data is huge, and that’s generally untapped because of the narrow AI capabilities that we previously. We had we made a lot of progress on, you know what we call structured data like time series forecasting, recommender systems, anything you could put in tables. But on a structured data which is video, audio, image and text are things that you know started happening later, you know more recently. But language was the very hard one because we could get language to be kind. Of sort of. Close, but not exactly as good as these large language model we’re able to do that, and the adoption is simply because everybody was so thirsty for having these types of capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is and and you know if you think about them the way those types of capabilities are happening today is that we don’t have any good way to automate them because they’re very fuzzy. It usually requires A level of knowledge to know how to handle them. At least, you know, language. Knowledge to read something and react to it, and all of a sudden others are giving us those capabilities. So you know, we’re we’re able to consider for the first time. Automating those things I’ve been trying to throw around this term that I’m trying to spin called knowledge OPS, which I think is a continuation of, you know, Dev OPS, data OPS and Nops. And it is knowledge OPS. It is really, you know, operationalizing knowledge intensive tasks that were not available before this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, so I want to get into the the point about these large language models like how how they’re generated and we know that there is indiscriminate scraping across the web. I don’t think. I don’t think anybody ever thought about the privacy implications of just taking the web and saying I’m going to put it all into all these Data sets that we’re going to train from so address the idea of&nbsp; There’s only a few companies that have the ability to scrape the Internet and develop models from that. From a cost perspective. So what happens with other companies who use, let’s say the API’s from these models and they fine tune them for themselves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is, I guess, even from an ownership or control perspective, how does that work in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new world. That’s a very unresolved issue. Like we are in very, very early days of figuring out how this might work. You know, probably a lawyer is or a copyright person is is in a better place to comment on what it should look like. But currently what is happening is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, you know, as you said, they’ve used data from the Internet without necessarily even asking. Can we, you know, the very good old trick of, you know, ask for forgiveness and. And, you know, they are now trying to ask for forgiveness in a bunch of lawsuits that he’s, you know, gone through, that they’re going through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you know the the fact is that they created like open AI specifically created a model that that was the first product product market that you know that the 1st 2 product markets that which means that you know that they have their attraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which in turn means that you know they have the capability of generating a lot of new data that is not necessarily even available on the.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like famously their, you know, human feedback data was acquired like they just hired a bunch of people to annotate that data, right? Even, you know, underpaid from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard like I I don’t know if that’s true or not, but I I do. I have again heard that they’re actively hiring data annotators like people, that you would sit down and solve puzzles and write your reasoning or any type of, you know, human activity. You know, I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re hiring people actively to sit down and annotate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, those kind of things, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they definitely have the momentum, resources and technology to collect data at the rate that nobody else can, so that that’s definitely concerning. But at the same time, open source has not been, you know, inactive either. Like you know, we’re seeing a lot of open source models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some companies, for whatever reason, like, you know meta for example, are open source and a lot of the models they’re building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is an interesting play. And you know again like I don’t have the knowledge to know what is the politics of doing so, but at least the fact is that it is enabling a lot of the community to keep up and build independent models and fine-tuned independent models. So the question of you know, what’s the structure of the ownership is going to look like you know what’s the right economy around it? Well, that are very interesting questions and I don’t know if you know answers to them. But what I’m hopeful about is the fact that like one potential outcome could have been that everybody kept the models close to their chest and said nothing in the open source and you know, no open source project was supported and that would have been really bad. But at least the fact that there is activity in the open source community and at least some of the Community companies feel that it is important to support those movement. I think that’s positive. You know, hopefully there will be some forces in the market that create a New Balance that is better for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s actually, I think, a friend of mine who works with, I believe, the Biden and Harris government, where they’re trying to do this. I think it’s the, it’s the executive order for for AI ethics. I don’t know, it’s called AI ethics, but the idea that they could potentially audit you as a company so that you have to be a little bit more open about your model, that it regardless of which model you end up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thing, but that it it’s supposed to do what it was intended to do, and it’s also open to testing to ensure that there aren’t any potential downstream effects. I think that’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question is whether or not those companies that have been black boxes will will be forced unless legally they’re forced to open up the hood and to be more transparent about about these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I mean I&nbsp; have a bit of a cynical point of view about regulation in general. I I don’t find it very effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge with regulation is that it’s usually several years behind where it needs to be and very, very slow to be implemented and more importantly, companies know in and out of how to get out of them right and just make their appearance look right and move on. So&nbsp; think what what the saving you know approach might be is just to enable entrepreneurs, you know at altitude accelerator. That’s exactly what you’re doing. But just entrepreneur entrepreneurs or ambitions enable them to build alternatives. And make those alternatives available on terms that are more suitable, right? Like create a competition at a company Vision. He’s going to create a New Balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And moral, right? Yeah, I think I think so. But there has to be. You have to instigate a little bit morality or, you know, just because I I mean, at the end of the day it’s that it is, it is innovation. But we structure the innovation so it could be more accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s get into some misconceptions about generativity I’m going to throw a couple things at you and you tell me whether or not it’s a myth or fact, and why so LM’s can think or reason independently like humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’s one of my pet peeves. I’ve been talking to a lot of, you know, very knowledgeable like, you know, mathematics PHD’s and such about this topic. I don’t think there are good answers. My position is that they do not because, you know, they’re based on statistics and statistics, by definition, is not causal and in order to be able to reason you need causal reasoning, right? I think they’re very good reasoning. Parrots like they’ve seen enough text on the Internet that looks like somebody’s reasoning through a problem, and they can pair it. That, but the fact that they hallucinate is a very, very good indicator of saying ohh if they have not seen enough reasoning of this type, they’re just going to hallucinate that reason. So yeah, that’s definitely not the.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Got it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case that’s good to know, though, that’s that’s actually good to know that. They’re not ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would hate for for the 1st Integration of ChatGPT to say that they know exactly what Hessie’s&nbsp; going to say next. Right. So OK, so our LM’s unbiased and objective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are as unbiased and as objective as their designers, right? So like very much like all other machine learning models, they’re going to inherit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biases from their data and from their design. So for example, one of the things that gave open AI an edge very quickly was was the, you know, quote UN quote alignment with human preferences, but which humans, like humans that open AI said you’re the right group of humans to, you know, provide preferences for the rest of the humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, so LLMs can generate human like text. They are truly creative and innovative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the first part of that is correct in a sense that they are probably better than 90% of people in writing. You know, grammatically correct and coherent text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The true creativity. I have a hard time with. Uh, you know, even like things like, uh, mid journey and stable diffusion and such. You know, the majority of the creativity comes in pages and pages of prompts that somebody writes like that, that that the content of that prompt is creative. The rest is just the model, you know, replicating what it is told to do, and I think that’s the same with language model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I I found that like I had to on mid mid journey that generate the logo that I wanted. It ended up taking about 10 to 15 prompts to get it to where I wanted. It would probably it was cheaper because a&nbsp; full year license, but it for from the perspective of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I probably would have gone to somebody on fiber who probably could have developed it and half the time because they I was prompting what I wanted when I I completely did not rely on somebody who could have done it outside of the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without my interference. But I think that there’s some trade offs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, LLM’S can continuously learn and expand their knowledge like humans, and I think you already. You already said this one, but go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, if you have it lot of lot of money because you have to keep retraining them right, like and you have to keep retraining them from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they have this catastrophic forgetting problem, where if you just throw in a little more data and try to retrain it, it’s just going to forget some of the previous information. So the the most robust way to do that is to retrain it from scratch and nobody has that amount of money to just keep retraining these. And there are a lot of other approaches. Retrieval or augmented generation as you mentioned. But yeah, the models themselves, it’s very like that’s that’s why open AI is keeping the model from 2021 and not updated because it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So explain the how retrieval augmented generation and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that’s essentially the the easiest way that I like to talk about it is separating the knowledge base and the linguistic interface. So essentially you have to admit right away that the language model is just the linguistic interface. It does not have knowledge. It should not rely on its knowledge and separately the data layer is where the knowledge exists so that data layer could be actual. You know I don’t know structured data, it could be documents, could be anything like that. So the role of the language model becomes has he said this question that is what is what you will augment the generation. Therefore I’m going to make a query against these documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure out which paragraphs have a description that answers this question. Bring them back, put them in the context of the LLM and ask it to answer that question only using this text. So that way you’re using a reliable set of documents as your knowledge base as your database, and the role of the LLM is pretty much understand what Jesse said and then provide a good answer based on these pieces of text that I’m giving you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, basically, now getting to more fine tune the model specifically for stuff that you know that’s relevant or I would say like a good reference point for for the.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so fine tuning as a term is something else, but you are essentially grounding it into a knowledge base and that’s very important because there is also a lot of nuances around like when you’re separating the data and the linguistic interface, very much like a normal website where the data layer is separate than the UI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then the reason is that then you can put things like privacy control, access control, you know, removal of PII, and between these two, that’s exactly what you can do here. Now, right? Because you can ask me a question that you’re not allowed to know the answer to. And then this intermediate layer can just reject that question and say, hey, you’re.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not allowed to ask this question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, got it. OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the last myth or fact LM’s are deterministic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that everyone has seen already that you asked the question twice and gives you 2 answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s probably, I think, one of the reasons why if you end up building anything, even from a a stronger compliance based, let’s say in healthcare, that if it is deterministic, that’s a good thing in a way because now you can you have a better reliance on what the output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could be, but because of the way it is right now, generated AI is not even being considered as as part of, let’s say, FDA approval or anything like that, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I mean there, there, there are few. There are a few ways that you could get it closer like there this parameter called temperature which you can reduce which makes it more predictable not deterministic but more predictable like grounding it into external knowledge source like right. Does that makes it more predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could create verification modules that check the output and ask it to try again. If it does something incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though or, you know, they’re also, if you’re creating something custom, you could also instead of asking it to generate one response, you could ask it to generate the view and then do a majority vote there. There are ways to make it more predictable, but definitely deterministic is nowhere close to where it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about some of the issues when it comes to generative AI, I think one of the biggest things that I I’m finding and especially between the if you try to separate the haves from the have nots based on the size of the tech company, there is a capacity and not knowledge limitation. Can you talk a little bit about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, for sure. I mean the, the, the game of very, very large models is just one by the big entities because that’s where the resources compute the resources are to run these models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all. Lost for smaller entities like startups, because one one of the misconceptions is that all of them can do everything. You just need to throw the right data at them like that. That’s definitely incorrect. So you still have to do a lot with the right, you know product development, steps of figuring out the right problem, figuring out the process for a design for that process, create the proper guard rails around that process for the software to work in, integrate it into the work so it leaves a lot of room for startups to go out and figure out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these details, which means that sometimes you might not even need the largest model, sometimes for your use case, maybe a medium sized model interface with a bunch of smaller models is a much better plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the I think the knowledge gap, yes there is a gap between available resources, but the opportunity I think is is elsewhere the opportunity is in the good old business bottom line which is if you’re creating a startup go out, find somebody with a real problem and figure out how to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’re basically saying that we don’t have to throw out the old and assume that the new thing is going to replace it. OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least not not in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in your your term. OK, so let’s talk about synthetic data. OK? And so there’s an increasing reliance on it for, for training these large language models. And so I read something about potential model collapse and the degradation of the quality because of because now we’re.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating new synthetic you we’re we’re replacing data with synthetic data. Can you tell us more about what those impacts are?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, for sure. I mean against the terms of service of most of these large models, a lot of the smaller open source models are trained on the output of the larger models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, there’s this concept called knowledge distillation where you could you could grab a very large model that does some thing and then sort of distill it to a smaller model that you know repeats the majority of the behavior of the large model but is more specialized in how it does so. So because of this dependency, there is a bit of a concern that you know, depending on how the large model is behaving, the behavior of the smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autos might be dictated and constrain. So and you know, if you just keep doing this for for a very long time, eventually it’s just a closed loop like there is no not enough diversity. Which might or might not be true like I think the the opportunities that exist in the near term is is going to be all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, all the data that is not on the Internet, so like from a research point of view, yes, you know that there is a ceiling potentially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But from like a business opportunity point of view, there’s so much out there and most importantly becoming very creative in creating an MVP that allows you to create your own data sets. Is the name of the game that’s the most important mode you could have because.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know the rest of this stuff is what everyone has access to, all the things on the Internet. Everyone has access to even the data that that is owned by businesses. You could imagine that a competitor startup is going to, you know, come up with a deal with them and get access to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same data. What will be super unique and most like for startups is always going to be the data that you can collect yourself. And you know, in principle that’s limited by your imagination, not really anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, so let’s talk about. Let me see what one of the other issues that people are worried about is OK, amplification of biases. As long as humans are involved, I would assume that biases are, you know, commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, but you know having machines do it is also not necessarily going to change that because you know they they’re going to repeat the biases in data and the design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the the only answer is, you know, people sitting down and thinking carefully about and. But this is not always a bad thing like training, training is creating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This so like, you know, having an inventory of all the all the biases and then you know, a taxonomy of these biases are bad. And we don’t want them. These biases are good, but this 99% of biases are sort of Gray. So what do you want to do with them? Right, like the gender gendered language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a very good example that I like to talk about in this context, because English does have German language but a lot of other languages like Turkish, Farsi, etcetera don’t. And when you translate from one to the other it says you know she’s in there, she’s a doctor. That’s the canonical example. But you know, maybe that’s right. I mean, in a very specific situation. And she is the nurse. He’s the doctor. So, like, what is the right product design? What is the right policy on top of this translation that allows that adaptability that says OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, are we talking about a woman or a man in a translation? Right where the system should be. So essentially what we do with biases is a very non trivial thing for a lot of kids. Like there are some biases that are very clear are Bad. Some biases are very clearly good. Like, you know, alignment with general human preference. That’s a bias we’re creating, but that’s a good. What to do with the other? The Gray area ones? Those Are the interesting questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could be cultural. That could be that. Yeah. Their whole host of other values that you need to take into consideration. OK. So for let let’s turn a little bit to startups who are considering using these LM’s for their own purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From your perspective, because you work with a lot of startups who are starting to use LLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think are the things that they need to consider in determining whether or not that, first of all, are they going to use this, or are they going to use, let’s say, like you said, some of the traditional AI machine learning and what do they have to think about when, when, when they decide to make the switch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So I mean not skipping all the good practices is is the baseline, right? Like you cannot escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting out there and talking to customers. You cannot escape the the right, you know, product development steps. You cannot skip the right software engineering steps like you have to do all the above. And that’s like 95% of the game. Still the thing that is different is that now you have one new level block to put inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system you’re creating to solve with specific customer pros And that new Lego block has a bunch of new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in all likelihood, though, whatever you end up building for a specific customer problem is not going to be just one model. Like, you know, all likelihood, it will be probably 1 larger model, a bunch of small models, all of them interacting with each other, and the IP will be really about how these are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architected to work together to interact with each other, to control each other, to scaffold the behavior of the large language. And to verify that God reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then you know what data is supporting both The system right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And because you know the data that is available on the Internet is available to everybody. So what is your unique mode data mode? So again, like none of these are really new like all of these have been around forever. It’s just been systematic, principled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluation driven and really knowing what is it that you’re trying to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are they? Is it going to be different executional when you are start to switch to large language models because a lot of it is prompt based as opposed to natural programming?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, I know. So a lot of better, a lot of the better models are a lot less sensitive to the exact details Of the prompts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a lot of well designed systems remove the burden of prompting from the user and bake it into the back end to write the prompt. So a lot of the systems we design, we spend a lot of time understanding if the user says this, they might mean these things and they might need these types of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the prompt is written automatically in the back end that goes to the like between by child DVD. Is it is a bit of a weird product because the distance between what you’re writing and the model is very short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most proper, robust software products, that distance is much larger, like what you write is analyzed and added and expanded, and like write is a very good example, right? Like what you write is not the prompt, so it does still take a lot of software engineering to create a modular system that automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the right prompt. But and that’s like 95% of the game, so about 5% of it is still, yes, like the back end has to have the right system prompts and the user has to. And that problem will reduce overtime as we include more data into the prompt about the user. But in principle, yes, it will still depend to some extent on you know how the user is saying things on the interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, it seems to me that maybe this is a separate discussion about whether or not there is vulnerability for the software developer over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability in terms of job loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there is vulnerability everywhere. What I have is a hard time wrapping my head around though is the&nbsp; whole conversation around job loss, I think is a little misguided and emotional. I think what is more likely to happen is the job description loss, you know, like so far you only needed to write in Python. Now you need to write in Python but also be good at you know English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you’re a you’re a business person. So so far all you did was write in things in English. Now you need to write it in in a very specific way that the model understands right? So these types of you know the the details of the jobs are going to be fluid and change but, you know, just wiping the whole job overnight, I think likely to happen. So the big question for me there is how can tools like these that are automating some tasks within these jobs be used to then quickly upscale me to do something different that I wanted to do but I was not able to do before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, got it. So that brings us to your last question and it’s a good segue from your last comment because this is we’re talking about a technology that’s going to be embedded everywhere in business, in our daily lives and how we communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we’re philosphically and you and I had talked about this just beforehand. What is your sense about dependence on the technology that’s going to emerge in a way that has, I don’t know, where it has implications on whether or not we can control it? That it can behave as as intended and whether or not you know humans will make the right decisions. But as it as it’s as it’s being built out into society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean it is. It’s a, It’s a very valid and deep question, and it does have societal impact, right? Like I think as one of the topics that you know, I I talk a lot about is you know, the agentic workflows and multi agent systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I think they will result in a lot of redefinition of work, right, because as as we just said, the job descriptions are going to change, they’re going to turn into new job descriptions. But I don’t think it’s going to stop there. It’s going to just change organizational structures like, you know, if a lot of the work that middle managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re doing today or that cognitive handling of, you know, transferring the business metrics into specific tasks for, you know, the groundwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s, you know, would we need them anymore? And if not, then what does it mean to. If agents become very good at hiring gig workers to do something, onboarding them, having them do it, and then off boarding them, then what does it mean to have them have the boundaries of of, you know, corporate? So there are a lot of very, very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impacts on the future of work, I think specifically, but also in societal impact in general as you said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a hard time, you know, obviously it is very difficult for any of us and I have a very hard time predicting where it will go. But you know, my bet is still going to be on founders who are enabled well by, you know, money, capital and you know, connections and influence to build guardrails to build, you know alignment modules to build privacy by design to build, you know, responsibility by design, and that’s the only way that I think we have a chance of, you know, controlling where this will go or at least reducing the potential bad side of it because anything else that we would do like regulations like relying on corporations, none of these are going to be that reliable in terms of creating the right balance to end up with the right outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you create an LLM specifically for governments that will accelerate their operations in even their thinking, maybe just to give them, hey, OK, hit me up on what happened in the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that that I can catch up to how to build an LLM?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the the reality is, is that I wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If government had the funds to invest in in smart people, the way tech does, then maybe they would have the controls that they need in order to to really fully understand how to how to legislate this technology. But that’s the unfortunate part. And I think there’s that there is an imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, it’s capitalism that’s that’s taking over, right? So. Anyway, any, any last thoughts? This is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir Feizpour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish I could talk to you about These types of topics, you know, we can definitely talk about them for days and days and days, but you know a lot of the, you know, societal Structure that we have around governance, around work around, you know, social interactions. I think a lot of these are going to fall apart. You know, as these new technologies, you know, get more and more embedded and integrated into how we work and how we live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, obviously as you’ve highlighted a few times, doing it responsibly is very important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not bottlenecking that on one entity is very important, especially if that entity is large and slow to move. Like you know corporations or you know government. So I I’m very interested and always excited to you know have discussions around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this actually mean? Like what are practical, realistic ways?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of you know, controlling where this is going to go, and I don’t think control is, is is also the right, the right term to use like I think really what we’re looking for what you’re hoping for is you know reducing the harmful size and amplifying the useful. Wise right? Because the same technology. Yes, it can wipe out humans, but it could also potentially be an equal Using force in, you know allowing people to have access to, you know, building companies that they never previously had because it was way too expensive for them to hire engineers and product people and. And so I think that that’s really the balance that we have to figure out how to get right, like how to empower the good use cases and dampen the bad use cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hessie jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you. That’s amazing. Thank you for that. OK. So I think that’s all we have time for today and I I thank you so much, Amir, for joining me to discuss this important topic. And I think for the most part, this is this is a topic that many people really need to understand because it is now moved beyond the AI community to now like basically society, so I will make this available to everybody who wants to really understand this technology itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And how it’s going to impact their lives in the future. So thank you. And for everyone else, tech Uncensored is powered by altitude accelerator. It’s produced by Blue Max and Transistor radio. My name is Jesse Jones and I am your host.

							&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now we have the emergence of large language models, and today we&amp;#8217;re starting to see the speed of adoption, how we communicate, how we research, how we improve our productivity has actually transformed society. So LLM&amp;#8217;s offer remarkable abilities when it comes to natural language and understanding and the generation of more accurate and human like language. But they also introduced some new challenges and risks when it comes to the practice of cybersecurity and its agency. At its adjacency into data privacy, data breaches and attacks have been really prevalent in narrow AI. But with the increased vulnerabilities introduced by LM&amp;#8217;s, we&amp;#8217;re starting to see more sophisticated phishing attacks, manipulation of online content, and exploitation of privacy control. Goals&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome everyone to Tech Uncensored. My name is Hessie Jones. Today we&amp;#8217;re talking about cyber security in the era of large language models.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#8217;s a little bit of the wrinkle that happened a couple of days ago, April 22nd, the Biden administration signed set Section 702 of FISA, which is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act into law that essentially reauthorizes the government to spy on U.S. citizens without a warrant. So, I interviewed Christine Bannon, who is the US public policy manager. The time. And she said this LLM&amp;#8217;s will be used by governments to sort through large data sets for intelligence, making it easier to conduct mass surveillance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So today, we&amp;#8217;re honored to welcome Saima Fancy to be with us today. She has expertise in data privacy. And the intersection with cybersecurity and AI? We&amp;#8217;ll dive into many of these vulnerabilities when it comes to LLM&amp;#8217;s and will actually address the new law and how it legally undermines individuals data privacy rights as well as through civil liberties. And what are the implications for emerging tech companies? So a little bit about Saima Fancy: She has two decades of professional experience in chemical engineering. Privacy, engineering, law, data privacy and security. She&amp;#8217;s a speaker. She&amp;#8217;s a mentor and an active member and volunteer with the IAP. All tech is human leading cyber ladies, women and AI ethics, and the Governing Council for the UofT Faculty of Engineering&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;						&lt;/div&gt;

So let&amp;#8217;s start with your journey first as an engineer and how you eventually. Move towards data privacy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Yeah. So, my journey between I started with doing degrees in biochemistry and then chemical engineering from the University of Toronto set off to the traditional engineering routes in my career path worked as a chemical engineer in a environmental consulting firm, doing environmental side, also audits of different chemical plants. US, Canada. Working with lawyers along the way actually for the transactions that were happening of these plants and along the way of in between doing, you know lab work and presenting our results to lawyers and potential purchasers of these properties, I fell in love with law and decided to pursue a little bit of law. Not a lawyer but did work in a couple of boutique litigation firms and became a scientific legal advisor and picked up a lot of those skills along the way. Today, and did that for quite some time, had a start-up of my own where I worked with lawyers in essentially storytelling their stories by way of medical illustrations in, in court, and went all the way up to the Supreme Court of Canada with the the lawyers who retained my services and then went back into engineering again and ran many of. A manufacturing facility here in Northern Ontario of pressure sensor. Labels working with machinery and running businesses, and learned all that, and still I wasn&amp;#8217;t fully satisfied. I had all these plethoric skill sets, and I thought, you know, somehow, I need to be able to bring them all together and put them to really good use and and be constantly on the path of learning in perpetuity. And that&amp;#8217;s when I discovered. We did privacy in cybersecurity, and it wasn&amp;#8217;t it wasn&amp;#8217;t by accident. It was by design. I was looking for for a landings professional space for myself where I could use all my skills and I and I. And. And that&amp;#8217;s exactly what I found. And we&amp;#8217;ve got a bunch of certifications done, including a privacy engineering certification at Carnegie Mellon University, and from a few other places and yeah, the journey beginning with the public sector, where you&amp;#8217;re working for the Ministry of Health, going to private sector to Twitter, learned about social engineering and how that works. And right now, I&amp;#8217;m back in the health tech space again. So really, really happy about my how I came to where I am today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;That&amp;#8217;s amazing. That is so amazing. I I find, especially in this phase, when it when it comes to, let&amp;#8217;s say, responsible tech, you you either fall into it. Or you actually make your way towards it. And I think at the time that data privacy and even responsible tech, it wasn&amp;#8217;t on, it wasn&amp;#8217;t vogue. I think people just decided to do the right thing and they were trying to find ways to do the right thing when it wasn&amp;#8217;t popular.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Exactly. And for scientists like myself, a tech geek like myself, and also philosopher of sorts, who wants to do the one thing, how do you do the right thing by putting all of this together and data privacy protection of people&amp;#8217;s data is it is the right thing to do and. I love it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;That&amp;#8217;s great. That&amp;#8217;s great. Well, thank you for joining us today. I&amp;#8217;m going to throw a couple of stats at you when it comes to security breaches. Just to give context into how serious this problem is. So between 22/20/22 and 2023, there wasn&amp;#8217;t 20% increase in the number of data. Reaches the number of publicly reported data. Compromises increased 78% year over year from 22 to 23. And the average cost of a data breach reached an all-time high last year of 4.45 million, and that was a 15% increase from three years ago. This is an interesting 190% of organizations have at least one third party vendor that has suffered a data breach and. Globally, there were twice the number of victims in 2023 compared to 2022. So. What do you think? The underlying causes of these trends are especially when it comes to the the number of data breaches and the level of harm that they&amp;#8217;ve done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;it&amp;#8217;s the greed for data and and whatever means to be able to get to collecting the the stock stocking up of the data that big orgs wants, right. But that the fans of the world want. And with that coming in various acts. That comes irresponsible acts, right? Would that come deployment of of tech without doing enough soul searching and enough? Scientific reasoning which says, for example opening eye, it was released way too early, right and and sometimes a lot of these technology pieces are released early by design to be able to collect as much data as possible. The transaction is you can download it for free. But it&amp;#8217;s not really free because you&amp;#8217;re going to be putting in your data, which they need to run their models, because without corpus of data of that of of a magnitude that is in thousands or hundreds and thousands of petabytes, these LLMs can&amp;#8217;t learn. They can. Not a function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s almost by design. When you say like it was released far too early. But if it wasn&amp;#8217;t released then it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be accurate. So it&amp;#8217;s almost like a chicken and egg thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;No, they could. They could have purchased the data lawfully and trained it as such, but then perhaps they would argue they would have the arguments that you don&amp;#8217;t have the wide variety of data that you would you train on, right? Right. But the responsible thing to do would be to wait. Gemini wasn&amp;#8217;t out yet and he was ready. There were many other tools that were ready at the time, but they weren&amp;#8217;t released yet for that particular reason because they were going through sandboxing. They were going to validation, testing, verification, testing. Right. So I think a lot of this leads to it and a lot of. Times it&amp;#8217;s not done. Purposefully by companies, I think there&amp;#8217;s a lot of excitement. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of need for it. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of warrant. Everyone&amp;#8217;s waiting for the next twinkling toy to come out so. You know, there&amp;#8217;s a race for it, which? Which can cause inadvertent harm. And it&amp;#8217;s just like, OK, let&amp;#8217;s just release it and see what happens. See, see. See what sticks on the wall. So all right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Yeah, it seems almost counterintuitive in a lot of ways. Went for technology. I guess from a process perspective, Q&amp;amp;A, you know, ensures that the inform that the technology or the product is working before it&amp;#8217;s released into the ether, but when it comes to AI it it&amp;#8217;s it almost turns that whole process into its head. It&amp;#8217;s released into beta and then put public beta into, you know, and at the same time the harms get.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Yeah, and don&amp;#8217;t, don&amp;#8217;t. Forget a lot of these tools are not stable right? And what that means is that they are the developers are iteratively learning. They&amp;#8217;re fine tuning as time goes on. So that means that what&amp;#8217;s coming in is not necessarily going to give you the correct information of the output that you. Want, right? So we&amp;#8217;re still in learning stage and yet it&amp;#8217;s life on the on the worldwide form.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;OK, so let&amp;#8217;s talk about LLMs. So when they indiscriminately scrape information, it can expose things like your credentials, your API, or any confidence or any kind of confidential information. So from your perspective, are we much more vulnerable? Today, because it seems like we&amp;#8217;re on the defensive and trying to mitigate a lot of this stuff, that&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;The public at large is vulnerable, no doubt more vulnerable than the past 12. Not much to compare with to this is unprecedented, right? We&amp;#8217;re in the fifth industrial revolution. AI has been around for a while, but Gen. AI hasn&amp;#8217;t. So as we release these tools out in the public and not educate the public on how to use and yes. The vulnerability level is super high. People are entering in their clinical notes and records and asking chat GP to. So, to summarize or whatever tool they&amp;#8217;re using, right, not realizing that once you put your personal information in, it&amp;#8217;s gone into the ether and it&amp;#8217;s going to. Be used to train. Models, right, and that your information if it. Not protected redacted synonymized anonymize what not will be able to cause the output results to be able to reidentify you. Hence there goes your privacy right? So from that perspective, yeah, the vulnerabilities and all time high. And that&amp;#8217;s not just doesn&amp;#8217;t just go at a personal level at the corporate level too. If you introduce all these tools to your employees and not train them how to use it, not train them in the Area of prompt engineering the vulnerability is super high and for corporations the risk is even higher because they risk to lose trust. They will risk data breaches. Remember, as these tools are coming. Vote not only are we at the receiving end, you know, benefiting from it, but at the other end where you&amp;#8217;ve got the various actors, they&amp;#8217;re using them to fine tune their ransomware attacks, their fishing attacks and whatnot, and becoming more and more sophisticated. Hence you&amp;#8217;re seeing the attacks go up and the cost to immediate. Them go up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;OK, so let&amp;#8217;s dive into that. So can you mentioned a few there. Can you talk a little bit more in detail about the rise of some of these attacks and what are they?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Yeah, a rise of a lot of these attacks are the most common ones are from phishing and malware attacks, rate phishing, one being the easiest. Where this e-mail comes in, it looks exactly like your bank. The colors are right, the logos are right, and it says, oh, you know the there was money that was by mistake the drawn or and and click here and you can deposit back in. And of course, when it comes to something like that, you know your dopamine level goes high and you&amp;#8217;re like, Yep, I&amp;#8217;m going to do it. Click, click before you know it. You&amp;#8217;ve been attacked. Right. So that&amp;#8217;s the most common methodology, both from a commercial and a personal level and. As why? Why the systems are failing so much is because a lot of a lot of systems out there are legacy systems with faulty APIs, leaky APIs. People are still companies are still moving to the cloud, or they&amp;#8217;ve got a hybrid system, or they&amp;#8217;ve got just on Prem systems which actually right now seem to be a little bit safer than some of the cloud computing. Systems also the other thing is when startups are starting, they are not calculating in for forking in cost for security, for privacy concerns. And that&amp;#8217;s a huge mistake because by the time we realize it and we do it, it&amp;#8217;s kind of too late, so to speak. You know, if you look at privacy. And design principle #1 be proactive, not reactive, because reactive is not the way to be able to backtrack and try to fix your system from the get go in your software development life cycle. Putting these principles from the minute you start developing your software from the minute you deployed and the data gets. Ingested. Those are some of the measures of preventing these attacks, but these attacks are super sophisticated. I&amp;#8217;ve just given you some of the simple ones, but but they go through the roof in in sophistication to the point that they can bring from banks and hospitals down, which is what happening right now. If you look all across North America in the healthcare landscape, but hospital up to hospital. Coming down on their knees and, you know, protocol is don&amp;#8217;t give in to these the attackers. But that means a lot of data is on the dark web being. Sold for pennies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;On the dollar? Yeah. So I remember the attack that happened with, I think it was indigo. And the the employee data was compromised and unfortunately they couldn&amp;#8217;t do anything with it. They they gave in to the attack. As you have said that they shouldn&amp;#8217;t, they shouldn&amp;#8217;t. The only thing that they could do was tell their employees. Go back to your bank, try to try to change your credentials, and to limit the effects of them actually coming in because the employees had to give up. Obviously their bank account information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Because that&amp;#8217;s how they that&amp;#8217;s how they get paid. So from that perspective, it almost it almost seemed like. Large corporations are handcuffed and don&amp;#8217;t really understand how they can mitigate it. So imagine that from the perspective of a small startup that&amp;#8217;s just starting to collect data and they don&amp;#8217;t. They may think that they&amp;#8217;re immune to it because no, no one is going to try to attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;That that. Yeah. And that is such a naive way of thinking what these MLMS have done is essentially increase the landscape of attack of the attack landscape. It&amp;#8217;s increased so wide. There&amp;#8217;s so many ways for the various actors to get it. And they do get it. And they longer and they watch you function and your employees function within your servers. Living. Systems and then they find that back door at the right moment at the right time could be middle of the night and then boom, they get in and then that&amp;#8217;s it. The access is there and a lot of times corporations don&amp;#8217;t even know that that&amp;#8217;s happened until it&amp;#8217;s too late. So what I&amp;#8217;m saying is why allow that to happen? Why allow them to have find back doors that you didn&amp;#8217;t think of? Putting these measures ahead of time, carve money out of your start up in your funding ahead of time and make this a priority because all of this would be for not then, at the end of the day, you could lose your entire business if you don&amp;#8217;t to put measures in place. Which brings us to regulations, it&amp;#8217;s the regulations that are becoming robust around the world. That will bring you down, right? We know that in the year we know in certain parts of the States the punitive damages are deep and they are cutting in deep. Canada&amp;#8217;s catching up. We&amp;#8217;re getting there. And with AI acts becoming as robust as well, we can&amp;#8217;t afford to be less, say, less affair about this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;OK, so let&amp;#8217;s talk about another law and I alluded to it in the beginning. So this was the Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. And so just a bit of background for our listeners, this law was actually established in 1978 to spy on foreign individuals. This is the US government. That after 911 the rules change that allow the broad sweeping of U.S. citizens information without a loan. Now they call this incidental collection, they said. Well, if it comes in there, we&amp;#8217;re not going to, we&amp;#8217;re, we&amp;#8217;re still going to. Allow it right. So some key dates 2013 NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Expose this and this prison program. And infamously began to surface about big tech. Google, Facebook at the time, giving the government unfettered Internet access to people&amp;#8217;s data. That means later it was ruled unlawful, and this bulk collection of the US citizens emails they&amp;#8217;re their mobile. Communications their phone records violated the Constitution, so since then they&amp;#8217;ve actually added. Provisions to increase the oversight and minimize the incidental collecting of people&amp;#8217;s information, but ultimately 2 days ago, all three governments rejected it and 702 and Section 702 without amendment was actually now put into law. So now we have these lamps. They&amp;#8217;re far more powerful than what we considered, let&amp;#8217;s say eight years ago, when the AI hype was here. They have increasing context and understanding of people&amp;#8217;s behavior and their intentions. So from your perspective, what do you think the implications are for companies that actually collect the data and create these models more often? Yeah, with?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;With laws like this passing, I understand it&amp;#8217;s been renewed for another two years to be able to collect data and and force companies to. Hand over that data. The implications are huge, so if if the governments federal governments want to come and collect data on a span of population, these companies are mandated by law to hand it over, which is surveillance at A at and it&amp;#8217;s just been taken at another level, right in government related surveillance. The implications are scary for regular folks, day-to-day folks, and it&amp;#8217;s all justified under the guise of World state protection. Right. We need to be able to spy on our citizens living abroad on any foreign state actors that may. Sure. At the at the face value of it, it does look all right. It looks like OK, we need to do this, but it just opens doors wide for abuse at a larger scale, right? With the just a viable tool. So, it is unfortunate.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;What do you think that means for let&amp;#8217;s say, companies that collect information about their customers, but they do not want to hand over the information to the government once they&amp;#8217;ve once they&amp;#8217;ve requested it, like what can they do from a what are they doing from a technological perspective to try to protect the data privacy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;What do you think that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know what they can do because this specifies the law is is a nationwide sweeping and it compels companies to hand it over. There is no door to get out of it. If you are going to be collecting data you by law are mandated to hand over the data set. If requested by the federal government.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Other so in companies like signal or proton, they&amp;#8217;ve they basically said we can&amp;#8217;t access the data, it&amp;#8217;s ended to end encryption and it only allows you as a user to have access to the data that you create. Is that is that a way to absolve your responsibility from the government mandate? If you technologically do not have the capability of actually accessing individual user information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;What do you think that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Yeah, I would think so. I think that&amp;#8217;s a really good point you raised. There&amp;#8217;s something called data vaults out there where if you do allow your customer to put the data in there and you are just working off of the metadata, those votes are. Locked and encrypted and only the customer themselves can access them. Then yes, blockchain technology is another one right where you&amp;#8217;ve got the key to open and close and until unless you&amp;#8217;re asked personally, which the federal government won&amp;#8217;t come due because FISA doesn&amp;#8217;t apply to them. That is one way to protect that protect them, but that requires a lot more measures, a lot more, or lost less money, making abilities as well, right? Because now you&amp;#8217;ve really constrained your data pool and you&amp;#8217;re not able to use as much of it. But sure, that those definitely those are those are two, two good use cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;So you mentioned earlier about so, that&amp;#8217;s how how I don&amp;#8217;t I. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t say it&amp;#8217;s difficult. All of them. But I think they&amp;#8217;re not mindful at their early stages of the things that they. Need to do. To to actually protect the information that they&amp;#8217;re collecting. Is it because of lack of money issue or is it just not being aware?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t. I think in the early stages, startups care about developing a product that meets the market need. So they&amp;#8217;re so used to building a tool that has solutions around it that the thought of the data collection and what they&amp;#8217;re collecting probably doesn&amp;#8217;t come in until much later, so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;So I think, on mass, they don&amp;#8217;t think about that. So, but you say that data privacy security should not be left as an afterthought. So what can they do in the beginning to shield themselves from the threat of any kind of cyber-attack and minimize the damage from them?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Yeah. You know there, there are a lot of out-of-the-box tools available out there in the market to allow for allow them to put in new security measures within the cloud space to say assume where we&amp;#8217;re working with the scenario where all the data that they&amp;#8217;re collecting and their computing is happening within a cloud structure of their choice. Whether it&amp;#8217;s private. The public there are a lot of out-of-the-box security tools that they can buy and deploy within their cloud to manage those data sets and to be able to create their own cloud, classify them, categorize them, bucket them up such that they can protect them right and then monitor their clouds constantly to see if there any. Any infractions happening? Any kind of? Of loopholes, any kind of openings that are within their cloud structure, but these these tools are not cheap, right? And they are expensive and they can be deployed in the beginning, right. As you&amp;#8217;re bringing data in, whether it&amp;#8217;s unstructured, structured and the other thing is really important for them to know that if they&amp;#8217;re going to have to be dealing with huge amounts of. Data they need to know where it is. There are a lot of big, big, big data companies that have said we don&amp;#8217;t know where data is sitting. We don&amp;#8217;t know which data centers it&amp;#8217;s in you. Know it&amp;#8217;s just. Flying all over the world, that alone is a. Huge risk, the. Other thing startups can do is make sure that the encryptions in place both for data at rest and data. Transit a lot of times they only look after encrypting data at rest and they think, OK, we&amp;#8217;re done well. No, a lot of the infractions that happen is when your data is traveling from data center to data center, from desktop to data center and whatnot. Right, you got to make sure the encryption is happening there as well. So there&amp;#8217;s a lot available and we&amp;#8217;re we&amp;#8217;re sitting in a really good spot in time of technological. Evolution, where we can see we&amp;#8217;ve got a lot of things available at our leisure to be able to use not to. Is highly, highly irresponsible and the cost of that of those tools are coming down. But you&amp;#8217;ve you&amp;#8217;ve got it as your as your funding is coming in, you&amp;#8217;ve got to be able to set some money aside to be mindful of doing that. Just like for your data storage cost, you&amp;#8217;re mindful similarly your privacy and security tooling, you&amp;#8217;ve got to set money aside and purchase those tools and get them in. And right away so that you know you&amp;#8217;re going to be compliant with the laws because these laws are coming down hard and fast, they&amp;#8217;re robust. They have huge period of making and order making powers and they can shut you down the goals and the metals of the world are able to take the hit by the small startup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Can we talk a little bit about some of those costs in the past like that Google, that meta have actually had to pay in because they weren&amp;#8217;t compliant and and let let let&amp;#8217;s, let&amp;#8217;s be clear before the privacy, these privacy laws actually. Need to be a lot of these guys were already flying under the radar because they were doing. That, that, that didn&amp;#8217;t have a law attached to it, so they could do it. But they continued to do it even after the law actually came to be. So can you, can you remember some of the some of the infractions that that Google or Meta had to absorb because of this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;There&amp;#8217;s been so many I&amp;#8217;ve lost track of them. Actually, a lot, a lot of them. They&amp;#8217;ve appealed and now remember Googles and medals of the metals of the world have a lot of money so they can hire lawyers to do appeals and counter appeals and. Not right at the end of the day, they they do end up paying, but they pay it a lot. Lower cost of it and in the beginning of time before regulations came into place. Yeah, they were getting away with a lot of it. Even the beginning of when GDPR came in and they didn&amp;#8217;t take it very seriously and were able to get away with it. But now we&amp;#8217;re in a stage in. That the regulation ecosystem and the iterative evolution of it, that country after country is over 130 countries that have put in robust privacy and cybersecurity laws that have order making powers are no longer going to. Except, you know, being under the radar, they are aware they&amp;#8217;re technologically aware, they&amp;#8217;re legislation are being constantly amended and updated to keep up with technologies. So it&amp;#8217;s going to be a lot harder for companies to get away with it, even the large ones. But the little guys, they&amp;#8217;re going. To be wiped out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t. I think that&amp;#8217;s the unfortunate fall-out. Lack of legislation because, I mean, if you&amp;#8217;re a small guy trying to do the right thing, but you may not necessarily have either the tools or the financial resources to try to put everything in place and you invert inadvertently do something that that is not compliant. Then you&amp;#8217;re right, you could be shut down and it gives more power to those that. I mean within that space, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;But there are other things that smaller, some small startups can do. They can. They can practice data minimization; they can practice collecting data for the purpose that the data was collected. They can put in robust consent, consent management measures in place and put audit logging in place and be able to manage those logs and. And see who&amp;#8217;s got access controls in place. Right there. Are these other mechanisms and practices that are fairly healthy within data ecosystems that they can put in place that can help them get there if they can&amp;#8217;t afford the big out-of-the-box? Tools or or they can even purchase these tools, but smaller features of them and then eventually as their funds grow, they can enlarge the features and purchase more of them. But these practices are there that they can implement exactly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;I think so the companies out there like signal and proton. They&amp;#8217;re there to provide a service. They don&amp;#8217;t use any of their user&amp;#8217;s data for anything, even from a dashboard perspective. The minute you start creating these advanced services for your customers then you need the client data and then that becomes goal to you and then you can monetize it and then you create this downstream harm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;But even then, there are certain box tool companies tooling companies out there that actually allow you the customer to go in the safe space that create for you within your cloud where you can. Which the data with the tools that you buy from them, so they say we&amp;#8217;ll support you will give you the tools here is your space within it&amp;#8217;s your enclave you go manage it. We won&amp;#8217;t have access to it but we will support you as you need to as you need us.

And I I think I think as we start to get more into giving people control over their information and the ability to delete if they need to delete everything that we have to move the ability to create redundancy in our systems and that that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Saima Fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134233117&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;134233118&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;That ability to delete is not in the hands of the consumer, right? They&amp;#8217;re what they have available to them is the tool called forget me. The ability for us to ask you to forget us for us you to delete our information. But how do you delete data that you don&amp;#8217;t have a handle on? How do you delete? Any data that&amp;#8217;s not been classified and categorized as such, whether it&amp;#8217;s PII, Phi. Financial data, right. And how do we deal with data that in in a mixture of systems whether it&amp;#8217;s multi cloud, hybrid one, what about the fact that there&amp;#8217;s data duplication, you&amp;#8217;ve got data sitting on your developers laptop and you&amp;#8217;ve got data sitting in different cloud structures, right?&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;How do you effectively delete data then and comply with the law and that&amp;#8217;s I think that&amp;#8217;s the issue.

And some in the GDPR, I mean, these laws are so robust you can&amp;#8217;t even back up data as as an organization that collects data without consent of your customer without letting them know that that&amp;#8217;s happening, right? Because if they have. Have mechanisms where they&amp;#8217;ve locked. They&amp;#8217;ve got the keys to their data that&amp;#8217;s been locked. You can&amp;#8217;t just go in and take it and and back and back it up for them. So those are good, healthy practices, whether they&amp;#8217;re happening at large or not is question right. But it&amp;#8217;s been like – they&amp;#8217;re all there. There are there are standards out there like NIST and ISO&amp;#8217;s that help you. Get there right.

							&lt;p&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello. So by 2050 70% of the world&amp;#8217;s population is projected to live in cities, we are starting to evolve into an increasingly urban economy, and urban centers will will start to adapt and. Evolve to meet the demands of these growing populations from from an urban perspective, it could lead to economic growth. They can improve living standards, increase and improve cultural diversity. Here&amp;#8217;s some stats I want to share the world&amp;#8217;s urban population has been rising almost six-foldd since 1950, from 751 million to almost 4.4 billion people today that are living in urban. This is expected to continue with more people doubling in urban populations by 2050. Today, more than 56% of the world population. Now lives in urban areas, so when we talk about increased migration to these urban centers, it can pose other challenges. So, we see we will see accelerated demand for affordable housing with risk to potential overcrowding, pollution. And maybe rising conflicts and social inequity. So, this actually calls for more sustainable development to build the viable infrastructures, the transport systems, the basic services, the job opportunities to ensure that these cities are safe, they&amp;#8217;re inclusive, they&amp;#8217;re resilient and they&amp;#8217;re sustainable. So enter intelligent City and I&amp;#8217;m going to bring both Oliver and Odie to the state. And so this is this company is based out of Vancouver, Canada, and they&amp;#8217;re founded in 2008 with a mission to empower people to live better urban lives. And so this company aims to streamline construction processes, standardized housing in an effort to actually create a commercializable and sustainable alternative. So we have the pleasure today to speak to one of the founders of Intelligent City, Oliver Lang and OD Craig, who is the CTO to discuss the future of increased urbanization and how this company is navigating their challenges towards a world where increasing sustainable practices. Becomes the norm. So welcome both of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;						&lt;/div&gt;

I&amp;#8217;ll start with you Oliver. Tell me about your vision for intelligence, intelligence, city and a bit about the journey that got you to where you are today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Oliver Lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Yes, thank you for having us. Yeah. So we started until the city to really address 2 fundamental issues that we saw start seeing in the world maybe already 20 years or longer ago. Which really the immersion of, of climate change issues on one hand, on the other side, the the lack of choice and the lack of supply of affordable urban housing and and thirdly, also, we believe the lack of adoption of of technologies in, in particular in our industry like some. Have coined the term that we&amp;#8217;re sort of the last the construction industry development industries, the last laggard who has not really adopted the the powers of technology. This transformed pretty much all other. So yeah, it&amp;#8217;s about 15 years ago. We looked at what we think should be done and how we want to approach it and felt it was necessary to create a new company that would really take a very different approach to how we could get to these answers. That we thought are really those are global problems and that required sort of a highly scalable solution. To that, that, that could fit that that sort of scale of problem that&amp;#8217;s there. And as you mentioned with the the urban population, I think you know many of you probably heard the idea that you know to meet demand by 2050, we have to build essentially a Shanghai or New York City every every month for the next for the next 25 years and. If. If we want to do that, we have to do that and we not want to leave a planet behind the next generations. That is actually desirable to be on and we&amp;#8217;ll we&amp;#8217;ll have to really change the ways we conduct ourselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Sorry about that. I think I just muted myself. OD, You consider yourself a new generation of industrialized construction and in this advanced manufacturing platform on the route to a more of a carbon neutral future. So, tell me about a little bit of the overview of your plan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;OD Krieg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Yeah. So, you know, construction as everyone knows who has built a building, a house or was involved in any of that remotely is a is a pretty traditional and a very manual sort of workflow. You know every building. Is A1 off building every building is sort of a one time. Project where many many entities, many consultants and planners come together to design, engineer, and then ultimately build this building on a construction site. And that model has really not changed pretty many hundreds of years. Except that here and there are some technologies. Have you gotten hold? We are planning with computer software, but it is still a very sort of representational hierarchical approach to delivering a building and in any other industry we are. Looking at products. We are looking at, you know, laptops, cars and even ships. Anything larger even is a more productized approach or has a more productized approach which means that? The the engineering and the design and the planning of how it&amp;#8217;s actually being made is already done by the time a client comes and chooses a product. Right and to in order for construction to move into that area in order for construction to become industrialized, we need to productize, we need to think about a more holistic approach. What is the building made of? What does it need? How does it need to be pre engineered and understood from design? To manufacturing and to delivery on site to be to be more like a product and if that is the case, if we can achieve that, if we can get to that part. Now, now we can scale up the production of housing. Now we can actually start to make housing faster and provide it, you know, in a in an easier manner. Shortcut, sort of that, you know, typical 2-3 year process of trying to figure out how things work. And until you end up with a building that is. Extremely unique and and so we looked at developing a platform that allows us to design buildings within that platform from that platform. And customize them to the specific needs and the specific location of the building. Although it all comes from that same platform and by sort of bridging the gap between the scalability and the repetitiveness of a platform and the customizability that we need in our industry. We believe that we have a a balance where we can deliver housing at scale and that&amp;#8217;s really sort of the the fundamental of industrialization is now, we can scale up, we can speed things up. But on top of that, the question is always when it comes to construction, what kind of materials you&amp;#8217;re using, and mass timber is a very attractive material to use in an industrialized construction environment. Mass timber is anything that is, you know, thicker engineered timber. It&amp;#8217;s a specific description of thicker engineered plates and beams with which you can also build high rise. And it is easy to use in prefabrication. It is easy to transport, and it is a sustainable building material. And now you&amp;#8217;re starting to put a lot of building blocks together where you can say, well, we can build actually in a much more sustainable way. We can make use of the resources we have in&nbsp; Canada, can deliver housing. Faster and at scale, and by doing so also increase affordability of these buildings and so this platform is sort of the fundamental of of changing how our industry works. But you need to put together quite a lot of different puzzle pieces to to make it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;OK, so you mentioned. A couple of things there. And So, what I&amp;#8217;d like Oliver to do first is to explain a little bit more about mass timber and how why that is, first of all, more sustainable, but what exactly is it and why not like why move away from the traditional metals? Plastics, gypsum, asphalt. Apart from the fact that they&amp;#8217;re not as sustainable, why is mass timber more of your optimal solution?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Oliver Lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Yeah. So we. Had a very, very conscious choice a long time ago that we would use mass. Timber as a as. As the almost the foundations of everything that we use for a number of reasons a, it comes from a renewable resource resource that you know you know when trees grow, they they actually they sequester carbon, they store carbon. And so you instead of having a lot of carbon emissions, let&amp;#8217;s say, when you do a concrete building in the embody carbon footprint or everything that goes into the building, the construction of a building. With the timber building, you actually not emitting, you actually do the opposite. You&amp;#8217;re actually using the material that has embodied carbon is now sequestered into it, and is is a more sustainable solution. From that perspective. Further, it&amp;#8217;s against. You know, they understand that a lot of people have a structure, they actually extremely strong because in mass timber other than in stick frame that many people refer to as timber construction and mass timber, you cross laminating things together and an engineered product that&amp;#8217;s extremely strong and dimensionally stable. You get to something that is fire resistant. You know, if you ever try to put a match to a a log on a campground, you know that you can&amp;#8217;t set it on fire. You continually would. But with mass timber you can get to that. So you can we have structures right now that are completely fully exposed timber. Structures of the two-hour fire rated 2-hour fire resistant right again so. So that&amp;#8217;s a bit the revolution in in, in this. And then there&amp;#8217;s a whole biophilic aspect which we people actually love living with natural material and&nbsp; and be surrounded with something. That&amp;#8217;s most sustainable, but but maybe most importantly for us at the end was a decision we wanted a natural material that allowed us to bring together this natural resources with the powers of industry 3.0 back then our industry 4.0 now it is entirely machinable millable we can use industrial robots right now. To machine this material. To precisions of a millimeter or or or further and then and then assemble through Advanced Fastening, gluing technology, and so forth. Very large building systems from it, right? So it&amp;#8217;s a it&amp;#8217;s a. It&amp;#8217;s almost a dream material to industrialize in our sector that didn&amp;#8217;t exist before. And then beyond that. What&amp;#8217;s been really exciting is, and we&amp;#8217;ve been working on this, you know, for a long time with regulators and so forth. But that now the building codes over the last few years have been adopted that mass timber construction across the North American continent in most of the States and many of the Canadian provinces. To allow to build. Up to 18 story mass timber buildings now under the building code. And under a more and more unified building code. That allows us so. That we can scale across what you can do in other industries, right, a reliable predictable regulatory framework and so so many advantages by using this material that is really the foundation for almost everything that we do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Now, can I ask either of you like from what if you start to compare even the process of traditional construction with what you&amp;#8217;re doing, what is the difference in time to market?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Oliver Lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;So time to market in terms of if I can clarify your Question Time to market in terms of how long does it take our product to reach a construction site?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Probably yes I would.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Oliver Lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Say that there are a number of options. Where we can reduce the total time of construction by up to 50% a because we&amp;#8217;re first thing we&amp;#8217;re doing is what the prefab industry has done for some time. Right now that we&amp;#8217;re basically while we&amp;#8217;re manufacturing in the factory. The other people, people advance things on site and you essentially get parallel construction, right? And so that that speeds things up. But beyond that, you can also get to a point where you can get approvals faster, which is always introduced a lot of uncertainties, right? So when you combine that possibility of fast approvals. On on development permits and building permits. Because you&amp;#8217;ve productized because you have certified solutions, right, which is what we do, right? So we don&amp;#8217;t just do a one-off solution for that project as already mentioned, we go through full program of testing, prototyping, testing and certification so that we can use it across a whole number of projects. So we don&amp;#8217;t innovate on the back of a single client. We actually don&amp;#8217;t invent on the back of clients. We create a product and we delivered to market so that it can be deployed rapidly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start="18"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;OK.&nbsp; I wanted to add some stats here because I think what one of the reasons why you&amp;#8217;re looking at a more sustainable solution is because. The traditional construction industry does actually lend a lot in terms of, sorry, generating a lot of waste. Canadian Construction Association indicated almost 9 million tons of waste annually in Canada and the waste management industry this is 2/20/18. Quite old, but they indicated that the construction sector accounted for almost 25 to 30% of the total waste generated by all industries. So from your perspective, how much are you actually? Saving do you think or reducing in terms of waste?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Oliver Lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;&nbsp;There&nbsp; is a significant saving reduction on the way side because when you, when you productize for building, you basically lay out all the systems in a way that they are most materially efficient. Right. We position machine everything for that particular component and we&amp;#8217;re trying to have as little waste as possible and other than some sawdust call it that from from the from the machining itself so that that&amp;#8217;s the the waste reduction. On that end, I think that&amp;#8217;s very, very powerful. The other one is on to optimized buildings overall would really be materially efficient. So that&amp;#8217;s the the layout of buildings, the form of buildings that they how they fit in the urban environment, everything is done around really highly optimal design and engineering principles. So that that design and manufacturing are brought together. They&amp;#8217;re not one is an outcome of the other, but we call it, you know, design for manufacturing. And that&amp;#8217;s, I think a a thing again that was done in, in many other industries, but it hasn&amp;#8217;t been done in the construction. Sector. Yeah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;OD Krieg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Yeah. And if I can add to that, you know, I think prefabrication in general. Of a lot of the making of a building from a very chaotic environment to a planned environment, right. And the reason why construction is adding so much to waste is because it is a very chaotic environment. It&amp;#8217;s not very controlled and not very planned ahead. And so you do have simply because of all the trades working on site. And not coordinating very well. You just generate a lot of waste because of. But of course you also create much less quality because of that, right? So it is. It is literally like taking the pre-Ford era making of cars from sort of you know a very custom manual one at a time approach to an industrialized. Approach, which obviously has a lot of things have to change when you do that. But one of the effects is that you reduce waste and mass timber is great in a sense because it is wood and so even the wasted wood can be reused, can be used for energy generation, it can be, it can be recycled or or even upcycled sometimes. And so there is a lot of that that we&amp;#8217;re creating. An ecosystem here of using the natural resources that we have in a sustainable way, and of course we have to also maybe as a side note, we have to use sustainable forestry to actually do that. But then the wood that we are using and that we are consuming and the waste that comes out of it can also be reused and ultimately create a much more sustainable construction industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;OK, thank you. I&amp;#8217;m going to pivot a little bit because we we&amp;#8217;re starting to talk about how the the world is increasingly going to be more urban centers. And so intuitively, once it once we start to see increased migration to urban centers, we would assume that we&amp;#8217;re going to have increase in densely populated areas that it&amp;#8217;s going to increase the demand for materials for energy, it will drive up. Cost of housing it will impact the quality of life and even affordability. And also let&amp;#8217;s not forget that, you know, we could we actually have the risk of increasing CO2. Levels in in more urban areas as as we get more people into these centers. So Oliver could you respond to some of these risks of urbanization that the effects of greenhouse gases? Let&amp;#8217;s, let&amp;#8217;s take one of them at a time like heat islands. For example, low rising temperatures and surrounding areas can be exacerbated because of the effects of global warming, more at the local level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Oliver Lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;For sure. Yeah. So, I mean the issues impact of of climate issues like, you know, heat island effects and transportation issues and and everything that really we&amp;#8217;re dealing with in cities right now, there are there are there there are strategies to counteract these right and that ultimately create an urban environment that has more. Green space. This is buildings that are really far more intelligently integrated from a from a design perspective to allow for to counteract these effects, right. And so this goes back to design engineering solutions. This goes back to landscaping. This goes back to, you know, different pavements. That you use to allow for absorption of water, you know, and counteracting like heat, island effects and so forth to make sure that buildings function with low energy needs. So you they don&amp;#8217;t give off a lot of heat because they&amp;#8217;re designed, they highly energy in, in in very many ways. With low energy needs, low cooling and heating needs, they don&amp;#8217;t overheat by design. If you look right now in urban landscapes, you know many of the buildings are just glass towers with very low insulation value that dramatically overheat and wants out of the building. And the only way to keep them cool is to run mechanical systems that then give off a lot of heat and a lot of energy. In return, right? So. So what? What can we do? How do we address that? How? What can we do this so we can we optimize. So maybe want to sort of back up for one second here in the definition of because I don&amp;#8217;t think we have explained that sufficiently that we&amp;#8217;re really. As a product company, we&amp;#8217;re designing engineer buildings and we bring together these mass number building systems. We bring advanced manufacturing automation, robotics together with advanced software and all of that allows us to actually sweet spot buildings in ways that we couldn&amp;#8217;t before. So it&amp;#8217;s very, very powerful to look. God. The energy consumption of a building when you go through optimization, you can look at the construction cost. You can look at the carbon footprint from a number of different perspectives, from the embodied carbon to the operational carbon, and you can find that optimum between the the effect that the building has on the environment and the effect that the building has from a cost. Perspective in the cost of construction, the cost of operations and so forth. So the discussion about the environmental impacts become also one of affordability. What I&amp;#8217;ve said at the beginning, right, so dollars and cents. And they&amp;#8217;re not. They&amp;#8217;re not contradicting each other, then building environmentally sound and carbon neutral doesn&amp;#8217;t mean it has to be more expensive. In fact, if you do it right, it becomes more affordable because you don&amp;#8217;t unnecessarily heat the world around you. You&amp;#8217;re actually only heat and cool for what you need because you&amp;#8217;re creating a proper envelope. You don&amp;#8217;t unnecessarily. Waste materials and build with carbon intensive materials that require a lot of Labor that we don&amp;#8217;t have available. We actually use a material that we can we can get industrialization at scale right and so these things are all interconnected in so many ways. At the end, our sector, our industry, is directly responsible, 40% of carbon emissions. And if you add to it what the way how we plan cities and how poorly we plan cities force people into cars, then all of a sudden over 60% of carbon emissions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it. That actually is a good segue. I&amp;#8217;m going to ask this question about so. So now you have people moving into these beautiful places. Can you actually help control energy efficiency now that you have more people in these urban centers and there&amp;#8217;s going to be increased ability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;OD Krieg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Well, that&amp;#8217;s a it&amp;#8217;s a very multi layered question. You know because on the one hand if we look at our current cities, we see evidently problems of mobility, right, so. If you keep. Everything is as is and you only change one variable. You will probably not really get to a more efficient. More and more sustainable urban infrastructure on the other. And if you think about what happens if you change the way a city is laid out or you change the way dense a city is, you can actually at the same time increase its efficiency and sustainability because naturally certain demands will emerge, right? So tSo, the problem that we have in many North American cities is that we have this. Our contrast between very, very dense urban centers and very, very low density around the single-family housing. And so you have in in the in the single-familysing areas, you have too little density to actually. To make sense for public transport, transport or other public infrastructure to be in these areas, it has too few people in that area to really have, for example, public transport. So if you increase the density to a certain level, you can create an environment where you have. Public transport, but now you also have enough density to simply naturally create communities where people don&amp;#8217;t even need to travel that far anymore, right? So that&amp;#8217;s kind of the idea of the 50 minute city you have enough density for enough people to be in a 50 minute radios, so you have all the stores, you have everything that. You need. Plus you have enough density for for public transport to also make sense and now these people can move around without needing a car. So you have these compounding effects, but you need to increase the level of density to a certain extent. However, you don&amp;#8217;t need to increase the density to have sixty story towers. That&amp;#8217;s also completely ompletely miscommunicated because that level of density actually doesn&amp;#8217;t help us and it and it makes our cities, you know, it kind of increases that level of heat islands and and you don&amp;#8217;t have enough space for even greenery to be planned in these cities. So, you need to have a sort of a middle way and that middle way is what many talk about when they mentioned the missing middle which is sort of the four stories. To, you know, eight stories or 12 stories construction, where you have enough density for all of this stuff to make sense, but not too much density. So you still have a very healthy city and then mobility and energy consumption is the most efficient. And I think that&amp;#8217;s the a trajectory where our cities haven&amp;#8217;t really gone yet. And for the most part it is because steel and concrete construction are very efficient. When you build really, really high and especially concrete gets really efficient when you build 4050 sixty story towers and it&amp;#8217;s not very efficient, not very cost competitive. When you build 8 story tower. Or eight story buildings. But that&amp;#8217;s exactly where mass timber is. Is perfect, and mass timber is excellent for 812 stories up to 18, and that&amp;#8217;s where it&amp;#8217;s cost competitive to concrete and steel. So you can actually build for less money and at the same time you also build a much better building and a much more sustainable building. And you incentivize that, cities become more sustainable. And sort of become a more healthy. Environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Oliver Lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Just app, just one point there. When you look at North American cities, they&amp;#8217;re actually, they&amp;#8217;re spoiled so much that many of the city centers have actually reasonably low density walk around maybe other than Manhattan also, but most North American cities have long avenues, long corridors of 123 story buildings. And all these buildings are perfect for densification and that is what&amp;#8217;s happening right now. There&amp;#8217;s like three things that starting to align. One is is the trend that people don&amp;#8217;t want to commute and spend their days in cars. They want the 50 minutes. Cities are realising and they&amp;#8217;re absorbing these urban arteries so that you can put in 8 to 12 Storey buildings in the future and then as I mentioned, you have this new building code that now allows to do that in timber construction because before, if you wanted to build an 8 story building in concrete, let&amp;#8217;s say it&amp;#8217;s not this scale of which. Concrete construction is really efficient. Concrete shines above, you know, 20 stories, 25 stories. We&amp;#8217;re really out. The the repetition where where it&amp;#8217;s more. Effective. And so we have all of a sudden the tools available that we can densify our cities within&nbsp; the boundaries of what&amp;#8217;s there. And then as already mentioned before then really make make take advantage of, you know, public infrastructure investments for rapid transit and schools and anything you need to have a a vibrant. And there are many examples around the world where that has worked historically. That scale of sort of 6812 stories, you know, most of Tokyo&amp;#8217;s at that scale, it&amp;#8217;s the most populated city in the world. With over 30 million people and functioned extremely well at that scale, the city of Barcelona is beautiful example that has that density for well over 150 years now and so that&amp;#8217;s an opportunity right now. And again the the new set of regulatory frameworks and development of technologies that that we&amp;#8217;re working on. Opens that opportunity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Do you think that like because I know we&amp;#8217;re headed this way because we have to, based on the the Paris Accord. But as we&amp;#8217;re building for this new type of, I guess environment that that is our future. How do you see policy changing to reduce emissions when it comes to energy consumption or even just to promote more sustainable practices? Because I&amp;#8217;m assuming that what you&amp;#8217;re building will enable habits, better practices from the people that live there. But it&amp;#8217;s still going to take time for people to transition to this new way of living.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Oliver Lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Yeah, I mean we definitely, I mean, at least in our environment in Canada, we see a lot of policy change to enable you know the, the, the biomass sector. So you know timber construction is of great interest to Canadians. And I think to know people in North America across the board that you can use and activate and. Renewable resource that right now we don&amp;#8217;t add any value to. We just turn into pulp but and and yet trees, forests are really in many ways away to solve this problem. How do we build housing for 4 billion people on this planet? And so I think that that realization has started to come in and so as energy efficiency, right, really if you make buildings far more energy efficient now all of a sudden you have this moment where things switch because now you can use alternative forms of energy, you can use, you know ground. Source heating and cooling. You can use heat pumps. You can use solar because you just don&amp;#8217;t need that much energy on a per building on the per home basis any longer, and so it changes that and I think regulators have come into to understand now and the incentive. Realizing so you can get for example, in Canada right now, much better lending terms underwritten by the federal government. If you&amp;#8217;re building needs, so-called passive house standards or 90% reduction of energy needs on a building and you can get additional density in cities, for example in like in Vancouver, for example, was just released. You can make it another 20 or 25%. Extra height and density if you build in timber and we&amp;#8217;re hearing from some cities now, they&amp;#8217;re incentivizing the size 50% additional height and density, so it changes it. It creates an incentive. Of on one end, regulation, as I mentioned from the building code to development bylaws and also provide far less hurdles and to adopt really these new technologies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Thank you, Oliver. OK, I&amp;#8217;m going through the last question at OD Intelligence city is the name of your organization, but Canada is still actually, I guess wrestling with with building its first smart city. And I assume where you are is probably going to be in Vancouver. But like from their perspective? What are the lessons that we can learn from sidewalk labs here in Toronto? I don&amp;#8217;t know. I think it was less than less than 5-6 years ago to create an environment that really works for citizens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;OD Krieg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Yeah, uh, we work in Toronto too. Umm actually. So this is definitely an important question. Uh, Sidewalk labs try to build a smart city neighborhood with a heavy focus on, uhm, data collection and using that to make the neighborhood, you know more efficient? Definitely, but I think. What led to a lot of pushback is the idea that a single company would hold a lot of data. And I think that is something we will have to consider as our buildings and our cities become smarter or more intelligent and more interconnected. You know, I think there are many, many reasons why we want to have data collection. If you look at a single building, I think a single building is a multifamily, but. Is is would be very. It would be very beneficial for that building to collect information and to know about, for example, at any given point how many people are currently at home, how many people have their windows open, how much heat or how much cooling is needed in that building? How much energy do I need to? Take from the network how much energy can I maybe produce if I if I have solar panels? On my roof. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of data that can be managed even for maintenance, right? Lots of sensors can be used and and the data can be interpreted to understand if any maintenance is coming up or if anything is going to fail. That&amp;#8217;s also where AI comes in. I think. Also that sort of data collection, big data interpretation of what&amp;#8217;s going to happen. With this building, but then of course, on a city scale, you want to also understand or communicate between different buildings. I think especially as the overall energy consumption of buildings gets reduced, the energy creation on buildings such as solar panels or you know in. Ground can actually be shared between buildings, and we can. Create a network of. Energy sharing and brokering. But of course, cities also might want to understand if they can introduce more intelligent transport solutions. So, for example, you know, what&amp;#8217;s the current demand on public transit? Do I need to increase the number of buses or trains are to decrease them to save energy. So all of that ultimately. Access to a more efficient and more sustainable infrastructure and and better buildings and cities. But the data has to be anonymous. The data has to be not held by a single company. It has to be shared. It has to be completely anonymised. And I think we need a big framework and I think that&amp;#8217;s a policy comes into a data framework, a data infrastructure where these things can be communicated as safe and reliable way and not be exploited for, you know, making specific decisions for a company to to make more money. Out of it, rather than actually helping the city to become more sustainable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Hessie Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:279}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Thank you. That&amp;#8217;s a very good answer for some, for someone who&amp;#8217;s actually addressing somebody who&amp;#8217;s a Privacy nut. OK, so that&amp;#8217;s all we have time for today. And I thank Oliver and OD from intelligent City for joining us. I look forward to a future where people can live at this convenience of the smart city. It&amp;#8217;s more resilient, it&amp;#8217;s more sustainable. And these days, especially with rising inflation, it&amp;#8217;s more affordable. So. Tech and sensor. By the way, is powered by altitude accelerator and produced by blue mix and transistor radio. My name is Hessie Jones and until next time everyone have fun and stay safe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;In the technology startup space, few sectors present as many opportunities and challenges as sustainability. Aaron Guan, founder of Neptune Nanotechnologies Inc., is driving change with innovative bio-nanotechnology. In a recent session of our Ask a Founder series, Guan shared his invaluable insights on the nuances of raising capital in the sustainability sector, navigating regulatory approvals, strategically positioning a startup through aligning with market trends, and building a strong, supportive network. His journey, marked by resilience and innovation, provides valuable insights for aspiring entrepreneurs in biotech, and those wrestling with developing solid foundations for the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-family ), Sans-serif; font-weight: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-weight );"&gt;We will delve into the key highlights from Guan’s session, including practical strategies for securing funding, lessons from early failures, and leveraging government grants. We will explore how his approach to strategic positioning and networking can help founders succeed in the competitive field of sustainable technology. As he notes,&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the timing right now is actually great if you want to start a new clean tech or a green tech business because the industry is at the intersection of two mega trends.”&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Three Keys to Success&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Guan put it, his entrepreneurial journey is not just a story of successes but also of valuable lessons learned from failures. One lesson revolves around the importance of knowledge, network, and community in navigating the challenges of entrepreneurship. As Guan articulates, &amp;#8220;These three seemingly unrelated things–they&amp;#8217;re very much interconnected.&amp;#8221; He draws from his own experience of facing a critical decision in his previous venture, where he learned firsthand the significance of these elements.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guan recalls a pivotal moment where he was pressured to enter a business deal he was unsure of. As he reflects, &amp;#8220;I didn&amp;#8217;t have full appreciation of the gravity of the situation. Luckily, I had made some good friends among fellow startup founders. I was able to talk things through and get the consensus which was to leave and start clean &amp;#8221; This experience taught Guan the value of having a supportive community and network on which to lean during tough or overwhelming times.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Guan highlights the importance of acquiring business knowledge through continuous learning, especially in areas like governance, corporate structure, and voting rights, which are crucial for startup success but often overlooked by new entrepreneurs. He admits to being underinformed in these areas when he started his first business but credits his network for helping him navigate these complexities over time. As he acknowledges, “The startup ecosystem in Canada has matured significantly compared to decades ago, and institutions like Altitude Accelerator exemplify this growth by providing trustworthy and comprehensive information. I encourage you to take full advantage of such resources.” Guan&amp;#8217;s experience and advice underscores the importance of leveraging resources, institutions, and networks to gain insights that can help avoid early pitfalls and navigate the complexities of entrepreneurship effectively.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategic Positioning: Leveraging Market Trends&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, one of the most critical aspects of building a successful startup is strategically positioning your firm. Guan emphasizes the importance of aligning with market trends to ensure that your business is not only relevant but also poised for growth. He states, “When we talk about building a business, we really must think about and work with the market trend rather than against it&amp;#8230; If you have a technology that touches upon both the performance and sustainability aspects, I think right now is the time to build a venture.&amp;#8221; This ideology and approach are fundamental to the success of a founder’s business, allowing their company to tap into the growing demand for sustainable and innovative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Guan highlights the need to continuously assess and adapt to market demands. He mentions, “Initially for your start-up, you want to craft a very concise, 30-second elevator pitch to grabs people&amp;#8217;s attention. But once you have their attention, the substance behind the pitch is crucial: the market, the value proposition, and the market scale all significantly impact valuation.&amp;#8221; This perspective underscores the importance of not only identifying market trends but also understanding the underlying factors that drive them. By staying agile and responsive, founders can position their ventures for long-term success in the ever-evolving landscape of sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raising Capital Effectively&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising capital is a crucial step in the entrepreneurial journey, requiring a nuanced understanding of both strategic engagement with potential investors and the maintenance of control over the venture&amp;#8217;s direction. Guan&amp;#8217;s experience highlights the importance of aligning with investors who share the founder&amp;#8217;s vision and understanding the implications of equity distribution. Entrepreneurs must carefully negotiate the terms of investment to avoid overly dilutive funding rounds that could jeopardize their control and future decision-making. Guan reflects, &amp;#8220;I learned in the past, the earlier stage you are at, the more control you need in the company.&amp;#8221;&nbsp; Guan further emphasized that the balance of equity and non-dilutive funding should also be considered, as combining these can optimize the overall cost of capital and align with the company’s growth phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leveraging Government Grants and Non-Dilutive Funding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to private investments, Guan highlighted the importance of leveraging government grants and non-dilutive funding. He noted, “We’ve also raised over two and a half million dollars to date… the rest being non-dilutive grants from agencies such as SDTC, OCI, and CFTC”. These funds provided crucial support without diluting the company’s equity, allowing Neptune Nanotechnologies to maintain control while advancing their research and development efforts. The strategic use of non-dilutive funding can be a game-changer for startups. These funds allow companies to develop their technologies and scale operations without impacting equity or shareholder structure. Guan’s approach exemplifies how startups can effectively use these funds to bridge financial gaps while continuing to innovate. By securing grants, Neptune Nanotechnologies was able to invest in R&amp;amp;D and infrastructure, essential for gaining a competitive edge in the biotech field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guan&amp;#8217;s ability to secure such funding reflects a deep understanding of the funding landscape, which includes recognizing the importance of aligning the company’s projects with the goals and priorities of funding agencies. Moreover, non-dilutive funding often comes with the added benefit of credibility and validation of the startup’s technology, making it an attractive aspect for future rounds of funding from private investors. The endorsement by established institutions can be a powerful tool in subsequent negotiations, reinforcing the company’s valuation and potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aaron Guan&amp;#8217;s journey with Neptune Nanotechnologies offers invaluable lessons for aspiring entrepreneurs in the sustainability sector. His emphasis on the interconnectedness of knowledge, network, and community, along with the importance of strategic positioning and understanding market trends, provides a robust framework for startup success. Guan&amp;#8217;s insights on raising capital, balancing equity with non-dilutive funding, and leveraging government grants highlight critical strategies for maintaining control and fostering growth. By learning from his experiences and applying these principles, founders can navigate the complexities of entrepreneurship and build ventures that are both innovative and resilient in the dynamic field of sustainable technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking to transform your startup into a market leader and gain more sales traction?

					&lt;description&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;by Hessie Jones By 2050, it is estimated that&amp;#160;70% of the global population&amp;#160;will reside in urban areas. This shift signifies a transition to a predominantly urban economy. Cities will need to evolve and adapt to cater to their expanding populations. Urbanization presents opportunities for economic growth, enhanced living standards, and increased cultural diversity.

							&lt;p&gt;By 2050, it is estimated that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/overview" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/overview" aria-label="70% of the global population"&gt;70% of the global population&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;will reside in urban areas. This shift signifies a transition to a predominantly urban economy. Cities will need to evolve and adapt to cater to their expanding populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urbanization presents opportunities for economic growth, enhanced living standards, and increased cultural diversity. Historical data underscores this trend: since 1950, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/overview" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/overview" aria-label="world’s urban population has surged"&gt;world’s urban population has surged&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;from 751 million to 4.4 billion. This trajectory is expected to continue, potentially doubling the current urban population by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, over 56% of the world’s population lives in urban areas. This influx into cities introduces challenges such as heightened demand for affordable housing, leading to potential overcrowding, increased pollution, escalated conflicts, and social inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing these issues requires a commitment to sustainable development: constructing robust infrastructures, efficient transport systems, and essential services, along with creating ample job opportunities. Such measures are key to ensuring that cities remain inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://intelligent-city.com/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://intelligent-city.com/" aria-label="Intelligent City"&gt;Intelligent City&lt;/a&gt;, based out of Vancouver, British Columbia with a mission to empower people to live better urban lives. Their goal is to provide a scalable global solution for two interconnected global problems: a housing industry in crisis and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met with Oliver Lang, Chief Executive Officer and Cofounder, Cindy Wilson, Chief Culture Officer and Cofounder, and OD Krieg, Chief Technology Officer to discuss the future of increased urbanization and how their company is navigating their challenges towards a world where increasing sustainable practices becomes the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Necessity to Transform the Construction Industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oliver Lang and Cindy Wilson founded Intelligent City in 2008 to tackle three major issues that have been emerging over the past two decades. First, the growing impact of climate change; second, the persistent shortage of affordable urban housing and third, the construction and development industries&amp;#8217; slow adoption of technology, often referred to as the last holdouts against the widespread use of tech advancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 15 years ago, they identified these global challenges and recognized the need for innovative solutions that could be scaled up to address these vast problems. This led to the creation of Intelligent City, as Lang reflects,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To keep up with the rising urban population, we need to build a city the size of Shanghai or New York every month for the next 25 years. If we are to meet this demand without compromising the quality of life for future generations, it&amp;#8217;s important that we transform the way we operate and build.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligent City considers themselves a new generation of “industrialized construction and advanced manufacturing that is marching towards a carbon-neutral future.” Lang adds that as an industry first, “We have commenced manufacturing of certified building systems compliant with the high rise mass timber building code using AI through data integration, software automation and advanced robotics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krieg, Intelligent City’s CTO, confronts the traditional and manual workflows entrenched in the building industry and remarks,&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Construction has historically been a sector where each project is unique—a one-off endeavor involving numerous entities, consultants, and planners who come together to design, engineer, and build on site. This model has remained largely unchanged for centuries.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite some technological advances, such as integration of planning software Krieg emphasizes that the approach is still highly hierarchical. Other industries, in contrast, have adopted a more productized approach. He explains, &amp;#8220;In industries like manufacturing of laptops or cars, the product design, engineering, and planning are completed long before the client selects the product.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To revolutionize construction, Krieg proposes a shift towards industrialization by adopting a holistic, productized approach, &amp;#8220;We need to think about what the building is made of, its requirements, and how it can be pre-engineered from design to manufacturing, and delivery on site, making it more akin to a product, but without losing the ability to customize.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transition could drastically shorten the traditional two-to-three-year process of building construction, making it faster and more efficient. Intelligent City developed a platform that allows for designing buildings that can be customized to specific needs and locations yet derived from the same foundational platform. This balances scalability with the necessary customization in construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lang believes this balance is the key to delivering housing at scale, &amp;#8220;By bridging the gap between scalability and customization, we can significantly increase the production and affordability of housing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the use of mass timber represents a strategic choice. Lang describes mass timber as &amp;#8220;thicker engineered timber that allows for high-rise construction and is both easy to use in prefabrication and sustainable.&amp;#8221; He asserts that this material leverages Canadian resources to deliver housing more sustainably and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass Timber as Construction Material’s Sustainable Alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s construction methods rely heavily on materials such as concrete and steel, which have substantial carbon footprints due to their extraction, manufacturing, and transportation processes. The extraction and consumption of water, time and mineral resources can lead to depletion and disruption of the ecosystem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction and operation of buildings are responsible for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://newbuildings.org/code_policy/embodied-carbon/#:~:text=Building%20operations%20and%20construction%2Drelated,operations%2C%20and%20end%20of%20life." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://newbuildings.org/code_policy/embodied-carbon/#:~:text=Building%20operations%20and%20construction%2Drelated,operations%2C%20and%20end%20of%20life." aria-label="39%"&gt;39%&lt;/a&gt;of “humanity’s green house gas emissions”. In addition, according to the Canadian Construction Association (CCA), in 2021 the Canadian construction, renovation and demolition sector generated an estimated&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.light-house.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Residential-Construction-Waste-Analysis-May-27-2021.pdf" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.light-house.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Residential-Construction-Waste-Analysis-May-27-2021.pdf" aria-label="four million tonnes"&gt;four million tonnes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of waste annually that included concrete, wood, metals, plastics, asphalt and gypsum. According to a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.light-house.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Residential-Construction-Waste-Analysis-May-27-2021.pdf" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.light-house.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Residential-Construction-Waste-Analysis-May-27-2021.pdf" aria-label="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, only 16% of construction, renovation and demolition (CRD) waste was reused or recycled while the remaining 84% was disposed mainly in landfills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lang declares the company made a deliberate decision long ago to widely use mass timber, as it serves as the cornerstone of their construction for two reasons: Timber is a renewable resource, and trees sequester carbon as they grow, which means timber buildings store carbon rather than releasing it, unlike their concrete structures counterparts that have higher carbon footprints. As well, the use of mass timber involves cross-laminating engineered wood products to create exceptionally strong and dimensionally stable materials that are also fire resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass timber has revolutionized the construction industry. When deciding this, the founders desired a natural material that seamlessly integrated renewable resources with advanced technology. Krieg explains, “This material is entirely machinable, using industrial robots, to tolerances within a millimeter. With advanced fastening and gluing technology, we can construct large building systems from this material, making it a dream material for industrializing construction in a way that was previously impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent update to building codes, which the team had worked on with regulators for the last decade, allows mass timber construction across North America. Now, in most U.S. states and Canadian provinces, buildings up to 18 stories can be constructed using mass timber under a more unified regulatory framework. This predictable regulatory environment makes it possible to scale the use of this material across the industry, providing many benefits that have become fundamental to the team&amp;#8217;s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Mass Timber Sustainable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite mass timber’s efficiency and sustainability within construction, there are still&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2023/03/31/mass-timber-carbon-assessment-timber-revolution/#:~:text=Felling%20all%20the%20trees%20in,a%20forest's%20total%20carbon%20stock."&gt;environmental concerns&lt;/a&gt;. One major drawback is that industrial-scale forestry, required to produce mass timber, can lead to habitat destruction, which can adversely affect wildlife populations and biodiversity, as well as soil erosion, diminishing the soil&amp;#8217;s health and its capacity to support diverse ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy Wilson concurs there is a potential for timber to be harvested from improperly managed forests but adds that Canada has the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://certificationcanada.org/en/statistics/canadian-statistics/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://certificationcanada.org/en/statistics/canadian-statistics/" aria-label="highest level of certification"&gt;highest level of certification&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of managed forests. Wilson alludes to the Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC), which certifies “good forestry practices in Canada”, according to “strict environmental, social and economic standards.” Canada has the largest area of forests where the practices are third-party independently certified (CSA, FSC, SFI) in the world at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://certificationcanada.org/en/statistics/canadian-statistics/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://certificationcanada.org/en/statistics/canadian-statistics/" aria-label="155 million hectares"&gt;155 million hectares&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Second in the world is the&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://certificationcanada.org/en/statistics/canadian-statistics/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://certificationcanada.org/en/statistics/canadian-statistics/" aria-label="U.S. at 39 million hectares"&gt;U.S. at 39 million hectares&lt;/a&gt;. Wilson demonstrates at this juncture, “wood is our only renewable building material and has a significantly lower embodied carbon footprint than either steel or concrete which are not renewable. It is the beauty of nature that makes wood an excellent material to build with and inhabited, while also helping to solve climate change by harvesting wood from managed forests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krieg adds that in Europe, many forests are sustainably managed, meaning that biodiversity is monitored, and these forests continue to experience net growth even with ongoing harvesting. Harvesting is strategically spread across larger areas to avoid &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://eos.com/blog/selective-logging/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://eos.com/blog/selective-logging/" aria-label="clear cutting"&gt;clear cutting&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; which is recognized as the most disruptive to biodiversity and releases the most greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the soil. Krieg advises sustainable forest management is crucial, “and with an abundance of old growth in Canada, deciding between conserving existing forests and developing new ones specifically for the forestry industry is imperative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still early day and as the world transitions, Lang describes in Canada and much of the U.S., less than half of the potential growth capacity of managed forests are utilized, and a significant portion of what is harvested is sold with minimal added value, such as logs, pulp, or lumber. He suggests, “By utilizing mass timber to address large-scale housing needs, this untapped potential can be harnessed. The forest sector requires improved management, which will align with the creation of demand for timber as a valuable resource, especially when coupled with Industry 4.0 and enhanced housing productization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All agree there are enough managed forest areas in the world to grow timber to sustainably meet today’s global housing needs. It’s now possible to build infrastructure that can be life cycle carbon neutral, but Lang suggests that, in contrast if the housing industry continues to operate as it has always done, “then the adverse effects of climate change and the consequence on biodiversity will become unmanageable very soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are We Ready for Increased Global Urbanization?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In less than 25 years, it’s estimated that 70% of the world’s population&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/overview"&gt;will reside in 7% of the of plane&lt;/a&gt;t with increased migration to urban centers. We can expect an increase in densely populated areas, which, in turn, will boost demand for energy and construction materials, drive up housing costs, and impact both quality of life and affordability. We also face the risk of rising CO2 levels. Currently, urban areas contribute approximately&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-01-29-expert-comment-urbanisation-s-role-climate-crisis-being-overlooked"&gt;¾ of CO2 equivalent emissions&lt;/a&gt;. This, alone, is enough to potentially reverse the progress we’re expected to deliver in the next 2 decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the potential of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.epa.gov/heatislands" aria-label="heat islands"&gt;heat islands&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;can manifest themselves within these urban areas, which exhibit higher temperatures compared to surrounding regions, exacerbating global warming at local levels. Structures like buildings, roads, and other infrastructure absorb and radiate the sun&amp;#8217;s heat more than natural landscapes like forests and bodies of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate issues like heat island effects and transportation challenges, as Lang expresses, require strategic countermeasures to create more sustainable urban environments. This involves integrating intelligent design, increasing green spaces, and employing building design solutions “with low energy needs, low cooling and heating needs, so they don&amp;#8217;t overheat by design. However, many current urban structures, often characterized by poorly insulated glass towers, significantly overheat and rely on energy-intensive mechanical systems to stay cool. As a result, they consume more energy and contribute to heat pollution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lang explains the way they’ve re-imagined building design addresses these issues,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We integrate mass timber building systems, advanced manufacturing automation, robotics, and advanced software to optimize building design in ways that were previously impossible. This approach provides a powerful means to assess and optimize a building&amp;#8217;s energy consumption, construction costs, and carbon footprint from both embodied and operational carbon perspectives. The goal is to find a balance between a building&amp;#8217;s environmental impact and its construction and operational costs, ensuring that discussions about environmental impact also address affordability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds that carbon-neutral and environmentally sound buildings don’t necessarily have to be more expensive. Through optimization of materials and energy usage, buildings can run efficiently and be much more affordable. Long term, however, reduced environmental impact relies on improving construction practices, rethinking urban planning and transportation systems and a heavy reliance on consumers adopting more sustainable habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more people moving into these urban dwellings, the sheer density could make it challenging to enhance energy efficiency as the pace of growth accelerates. Krieg illustrates within current cities mobility problems arise due to stark contrasts in urban density, and dense urban centers surrounded by low-density single-family suburban dwellings hinder efficient public transportation and infrastructure. He explains,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The density is too low in these areas to justify such services. By increasing density to a moderate level, we can develop sustainable urban infrastructure that supports public transport and reduces the need for long-distance travel. This idea aligns with the concept of the &amp;#8220;15-minute city,&amp;#8221; where people can access all essential services within a 15-minute radius. Sufficient density fosters the development of strong communities, reducing the need for cars and promoting more efficient movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, he explains that high-density, 60-story towers exacerbate heat island effects and limit greenery. The &amp;#8220;missing middle,&amp;#8221; as Krieg describes are those buildings between 4 and 12 stories high, providing an ideal density that supports efficient public transportation, community growth, and green spaces. Unfortunately, cities have not yet adopted this middle ground, often due to the efficiency of steel and concrete in constructing high-rise buildings. Mass timber presents a viable alternative for buildings between 8 and 18 stories, where it is cost-competitive with steel and concrete while also being more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lang highlights North American cities typically have low-density urban centers, except for places like Manhattan. These cities are characterized by long avenues lined with one to three-story buildings, which are ideal for densification. Lang adds, “There are three trends align to create the opportunity for such densification: people&amp;#8217;s desire to avoid long commutes and embrace the concept of the 15-minute city; the recognition of their urban arteries for future 8 to 12-story buildings; and new building codes that will enable more mass timber construction for mid-rise buildings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concrete construction, Lang shares, is typically efficient for buildings over 20 stories high and is less practical for smaller structures. Timber construction, therefore, is more effective for mid-rise buildings that can densify cities within their existing frameworks, adding, “Such densification can leverage investments in public infrastructure, like rapid transit and schools, to create vibrant communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When envisioning the future of sustainable construction and city planning, policy changes will play a crucial role in reducing emissions from energy consumption and promoting environmentally friendly practices. Lang stressed the importance of policy change in supporting the use of renewable resources and biomass, particularly timber construction. He sees this increasing energy efficiency in buildings paving the way for alternative energy sources such as solar power, heat pumps, and ground-source heating and cooling, which will naturally reduce the energy demand per structure and allow for a more seamless transition to greener energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lang highlighted how Canadian regulators have recognized these opportunities, providing incentives for environmentally friendly construction practices: “For instance, the federal government offers favorable lending terms for buildings that meet passive house standards, which require up to 90% less energy. In Vancouver, builders can achieve 20-25% additional height and density for timber structures, and some cities are considering up to a 50% increase.” Such incentives, combined with supportive regulations and streamlined approval processes, are vital in driving the adoption of innovative technologies and fostering sustainable construction practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Towards Canada’s first Smart City&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada is still wrestling with building its first smart city.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/29/1054005/toronto-kill-the-smart-city/"&gt;Technology Review’s&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;article, “Toronto Wants to Kill the Smart City Forever” acknowledged that &amp;#8221; Sidewalk Labs’ two-and-a-half-year struggle to build a neighborhood “from the internet up” failed to make the case for why anyone might want to live in it.” The outcome of the Sidewalk Labs debacle revealed a disparity among proponents who sold the glitz and glamour of what the technology could do rather than effectively addressing the real human concerns that surfaced during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Krieg, Sidewalk Labs&amp;#8217; attempt to create a smart city neighborhood focused heavily on data collection to improve efficiency. However, a significant concern arose in a single company having considerable control over such vast amounts of data–something that becomes increasingly important as buildings and cities grow smarter and more interconnected. While data collection has many potential benefits, such as enabling a building to assess the number of occupants, open windows, and energy needs, how the information is managed will be crucial to alleviating citizen concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krieg reflects, “Efficient energy management, like predicting maintenance needs and optimizing energy use with the help of AI, requires accurate data interpretation. On a city-wide scale, sharing energy produced from sources like solar panels among buildings can lead to energy-sharing networks and efficient energy brokering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds cities could improve transportation by analyzing public transit demand to adjust bus and train schedules for energy savings, “&amp;#8230;however, it is vital that this data is anonymized, shared responsibly, and not monopolized by a single company. Policy needs to ensure that data is used in a safe and reliable framework to benefit cities and promote sustainability rather than for corporate profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world moves towards a predominantly urban economy, cities must evolve to accommodate this shift, while adhering to an urgent global mandate to limit carbon emissions in the next 20 years. Intelligent City recognizes the need to transform the construction industry to address climate change, urban housing shortages, and the slow adoption of technology and their innovation to revolutionize building design, towards one that’s making it more efficient, and scalable, while balancing energy consumption with a view to reduce carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, achieving sustainability and smart city development requires a “village” that combines intelligent design, effective policy changes, technological advancements, education and consumer behavior changes to support the inevitable population growth in the world’s urban centres while mitigating climate impacts, with the aim to foster vibrant, inclusive communities.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Altitude Acclerator is pleased to highlight Deepinder Singh as the 2024 winner of the Smart Solutions Category at the Brampton Business Excellence Awards! An engineer by trade, Singh has seamlessly integrated his technical knowledge with his passion for languages, leading to the creation of Prudle Labs. This innovative company is revolutionizing the language industry by solving numerous existing problems and enhancing the way content translation occurs today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While earning his Bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree, Singh developed an interest in languages, learning German, French, and Japanese. His passion for languages persisted throughout his career, where he eventually led language computer departments and managed translation portfolios for multinational corporations. This exposure allowed him to identify key issues in the language industry, which inspired the inception of Prudle Labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Prudle Labs employs 3,000 contractors globally, providing translation services that deliver results in a fraction of a second. Singh’s role extends beyond his company, he also mentors startups at Altitude Accelerator and other incubators. His interests include photography- particularly landscape and nature photography, as well as cycling, reading, and meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh’s expertise lies in identifying and addressing inefficiencies within the language industry. While working at a major computer company, he observed significant problems in the translation supply chain, including a lack of transparency and high costs. His solution was to develop a single platform that facilitated collaboration among all members of the supply chain. This innovation simplifies global communication and is the foundation of Prudle Labs. Further, Singh’s specialties include project management, cost management, and people management.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Deepinder Singh&amp;#8217;s multifaceted expertise and passion for innovation have significantly impacted the language industry through Prudle Labs. His commitment to mentoring and community involvement exemplifies the spirit of Altitude Accelerator, and we are proud to have him as an advisor.&lt;/p&gt;						&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Journeying into entrepreneurship means founders need to lay a solid foundation for their startup. This foundation rests on three key pillars crucial for startup success: managing relationships, building resilience, and assembling a strong and reliable team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134245417&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:100,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:168,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:41,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134245417&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:7}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;In the early stages of a startup, founders often find themselves wearing multiple hats, juggling various responsibilities to develop their business. However, as the startup grows, the focus shifts toward constructing a team that can take on these responsibilities to drive the business forward. This transition underscores the importance of understanding one’s strengths and weaknesses and strategically onboarding individuals who complement these attributes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134245417&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:100,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:109,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Also, there is an art to navigating relationships–both internally and externally. Internally, founders must foster a culture that aligns with the mission and values, while externally, they must forge alliances with investors, partners, and suppliers who share their vision. This is not easy. Finally, resilience emerges as a defining trait, enabling founders to weather the storms of setbacks and challenges they face along the way, while remaining steadfast in their pursuit of their business goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134245417&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:100,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:109,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt; We&nbsp;delve deeper into two of our recent podcasts of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://altitudeaccelerator.ca/tech-uncensored/"&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Tech Uncensored:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt; “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://altitudeaccelerator.ca/startup-resilience-navigating-relationships-for-early-stage-founders/"&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Startup Resilience Navigating Relationships for Early-Stage Founders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;” with experts Devin Ramphal, Jennifer Cameron, and “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://altitudeaccelerator.ca/founders-how-to-build-the-right-team/"&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Founders: How to Build the Right Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt; with David Peterson, both exploring the nuances of building a foundation that can withstand the test of time and push startup founders toward their goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Navigating Relationships in the Startup Journey:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134245417&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:100}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;We had the pleasure of hosting Devin Ramphal, former CEO and Co-founder of Clean Air and Jennifer Cameron, Co-founder and CEO of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://invrs.com/home"&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;INVRS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt; in a recent episode of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://altitudeaccelerator.ca/startup-resilience-navigating-relationships-for-early-stage-founders/"&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Tech Uncensored,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt; where they shared their insights on the evolving dynamics of relationships in the startup world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134245417&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:100,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:41,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not uncommon for one’s entrepreneurial journey to begin with a group of friends driven by a shared vision. However, as the startup grows, the dynamics of these relationships undergo a profound transformation. As Ramphal reflected, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;“It was easy in the beginning, but it got harder when&nbsp;the business grew more serious, and we brought in other stakeholders, investors, and customers. When other people with different expectations enter, that is when the friction starts.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt; This underscores a common challenge for startup founders: the transformation of friendships into business partnerships, especially when external expectations strain these relationships. Hence, the need to carefully navigate these business &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;relationships require setting boundaries and expectations within the workplace from the beginning, avoiding friction and ensuring smoother transitions as the firm expands.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134245417&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:60,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Furthermore, there is a need for careful negotiation and agreement when establishing business partnerships, especially in the initial stages. Ramphal highlights the importance of clear communication and mutual benefit without one having a strong upper hand. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;He cautions against rushing into a 50/50 partnership, which would imply decisions ending up in a deadlock between shareholders and suggests, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;There are other ways to make the partnership equitable without giving away excessive equity or control. You can achieve this by thinking about it from the partner’s shoes and understand their motivations to see what other benefits you could potentially provide them with.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt; This advice stresses the need for startups to navigate the complexities of forming alliances while safeguarding their vision, independence, and control of the firm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134245417&amp;quot;:false}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;The shift in dynamics is not just internal but also extends to the external relationships crucial for the startup’s success. Strategic partnerships, supplier relationships, and investor connections all play pivotal roles. Founders must be discerning in selecting investors who not only provide financial backing but also share their vision. As Ramphal emphasized, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;When we were looking for an investor, what was important to us was finding someone that was well connected in that space; we were not just looking for money. We were looking for someone who could make strategic connections with customers.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt; This highlights the importance of aligning with investors who bring more than just capital to the table, and who can facilitate the growth of the company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134245417&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:100,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:168,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Additionally, founders must bear in mind the importance of protecting the firm when expanding opportunities or entering new supplier relationships, as Cameron reflects, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;“A piece of advice I would give to nascent entrepreneurs is to really read those contracts carefully. It’s so difficult because they can be so dry. But you can try to put yourself under different frames of mind under different scenarios, which could help enlighten what you are signing on to and give you some latitude to negotiate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt; This foresight is essential in helping founders understand the importance of thoroughly reviewing and understanding contracts, as they can have long-lasting implications on the business. It emphasizes the need for diligence and planning as well as the potential for negotiation to secure favorable terms and protect the startup’s interests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134245417&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:100,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:117,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Building Resilience through Personal Conviction and Mentorship&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134245417&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:100}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Founders must have unwavering conviction in their vision, especially during those times of uncertainty. As Cameron aptly put it, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;When it’s dark and bleak, which it certainly will be from time to time, you must have faith. I think that circles back to resilience and how much you are going to hang on to make your vision a reality. Because it’s not about the honeymoon stage and when things are good. When the rubber hits the road is when things are dark, and that is when you must get through it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt; With this advice, Cameron encourages founders to persevere through the inherent challenges and maintain belief and in their vision to survive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134245417&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:100,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:122,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Resilience also means seeking mentorship from external advisors. While being the CEO can be lonely at times, having diverse advisors can be powerful as they provide valuable feedback and different perspectives. Ramphal noted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;“As the CEO, it’s your job to take feedback and then decide on how you act on it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;By gathering many qualified opinions, you are essentially collecting data that allows you to navigate a better as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;the person on top. Having multiple advisors is critical because they have disparate points of view which can help&nbsp;calibrate your next steps.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt; Hence, Ramphal shows founders that this ability to seek diverse voices can help make informed decisions, which is critical for managing the intricacies of entrepreneurship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;134245417&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559737&amp;quot;:268,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:60,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Building the Right Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;In another recent episode of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://altitudeaccelerator.ca/founders-how-to-build-the-right-team/"&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Tech Uncensore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;, we hosted David Peterson, the founder &amp;amp; CEO of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.optimization.coach/"&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;ptimization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt; Coach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;, to discuss the importance of building a committed team for startup founders. Peterson began by underscoring the importance of timing in team building, stating “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;It is crucial to have the right team members at each stage of your startup’s growth. Founders should bring in new hires about three months before they are needed. This lead time allows the new team members to familiarize themselves with the company’s culture, values, and goals, enabling them to develop strategies to help achieve those goals.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt; In this sense, Peterson stresses the importance of acclimatizing new team members of the company to help efficiently integrate them into the company and its workforce culture.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Moreover, Peterson emphasizes the importance of specificity in hiring. For example, simply seeking a “salesperson” is too generic. He said, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;“You need to consider what it is you are looking for in a person and communicate this clearly. This clarity helps others know who exactly to recommend or connect with you. You cannot be too generic as there are specific solutions to your problems and someone out there can help you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt; Hence, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Peterson suggests that founders must have a clear understanding of the skills and qualities they need in a team member to address their unique challenges. Being vague in their search can lead to mismatched hires who may not effectively contribute to solving the startup’s challenges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Finally, Peterson delves into the importance of values and principles in hiring. He suggests that beyond specific skills and qualifications, founders should consider whether a potential team member aligns with the company’s core beliefs. He shares, “So you’ve got to find the right people, but you need to be clear what you value as a founder and bring in those who align with those same values and principles.” This alignment is crucial for maintaining a cohesive and motivated team that shares a common vision and sense of purpose. It ensures that everyone is moving in the same direction, deeply connected to the company’s core values, and fostering a positive and productive work environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{}"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Laying a strong foundation for startup success hinges on adeptly managing relationships, fostering resilience, and consolidating a cohesive team. These pillars are not just individual components but interconnected elements that together form the bedrock of a successful startup. Startup founders can strengthen their foundation, withstand challenges, and propel their ventures toward sustainable growth and success as they evolve.
